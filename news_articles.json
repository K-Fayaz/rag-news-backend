Gui Santos began the run with a layup and completed it with a 3-pointer, the latter putting Golden State up 103-92 with 7:10 remaining.\n\nThe Warriors never trailed again, but with Booker scoring on three consecutive possessions, including a three-point play at the 2:35 mark, Phoenix rallied within 109-105 before Booker's run ended with a missed 3-pointer.\n\nAfter a Curry 3-pointer, the Suns had a shot at taking the lead when, down 115-113, Gillespie misfired on a 3-pointer with 18.4 seconds left.\n\nCurry then hit two free throws, but the visitors still weren't done as Gillespie drilled a 25-footer with 10.9 seconds to go, making it a 117-116 game.\n\nCurry then capped his 28-point night with a layup off an inbounds play for a three-point advantage, after which Booker was off-line with a buzzer-beating 40-footer that would have forced overtime.\n\nWill Richard aided the Golden State cause with 20 points and Brandin Podziemski added 11, helping the Warriors' bench outscore their counterparts 52-31.\n\nGillespie finished with 16 points, while Oso Ighodaro grabbed a team-high seven rebounds to go with 10 points for the Suns, who lost for the third time in their last four games.\n\n--Field Level Media",

Greer and Sam Reinhart.\n\nDespite the loss -- which broke Florida's four-game win streak -- the Panthers are 7-2-0 in their past nine games.\n\nThe Blues scored the only goal in the first period as Neighbours tipped in a shot by Fowler.\n\nSt. Louis extended its lead to 2-0 on Berggren's power-play goal with 18:05 left in the second. Tarasov caught the shot with his glove, but the puck had just barely crossed the line.\n\nThe Blues nearly made it 3-0 as Berggren had a breakaway shot. However, Tarasov made a glove save.\n\nWith 12:25 left in the second, Florida's Seth Jones tried to stuff the puck in from point-blank range. The puck bounced out to the right circle where Jesper Boqvist's shot was tipped in by Greer.\n\nThe Blues challenged for goalie interference as Greer and Jones were in the blue paint. After a video review, however, it was ruled a good goal.\n\nFlorida then tied the score 2-2 on Reinhart's power-play goal with 7:15 left in the second. Brad Marchand had the primary assist with his pass to Reinhart, who scored from the slot, beating Hofer glove-side.\n\nFaulk then gave the Blues a 3-2 lead.

The plane was registered to a company tied to Biffle.\n\nOfficials will provide a list of the seven occupants once confirmation has been made by the medical examiner’s office.\n\nThe plane had been bound for Florida but soon after takeoff attempted to return to the North Carolina airport in severe weather around 10:15 a.m. (1515 GMT) according to FlightAware, an airplane tracking site.\n\nA picture posted by local media and social media showed a large fire on the runway amid the plane wreckage. The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a go-team to the scene and will brief media on Friday on the investigation.\n\nBiffle, 55, won 19 Cup Series races over 20 years, according to Field Level Media. His final race on the circuit was the 2022 Geico 500 at Talladega. He was named one of NASCAR’s 75 Greatest Drivers in 2023.\n\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina was among lawmakers to eulogize Biffle. \"Greg was a titan in the NASCAR community both on and off the racetrack,\" Tillis said. \"After Helene devastated Western North Carolina, Greg stepped up without hesitation by using his own personal helicopter to rescue victims and provide crucial aid to North Carolinians in need.\"\n\nThe airport was closed after the incident and the debris must be removed from the runway before it can reopen, city officials said at a press conference.",

Assistant special teams coach Ben Kotwica, who joined the staff this season, is the choice to oversee the unit going forward, per the reports.\n\nThe 51-year-old Kotwica has coached in the NFL for 17 years and was special teams coordinator for the New York Jets (2013), Washington (2014-18), Atlanta Falcons (2019-20) and Denver Broncos (2023-24).\n\nSpecial teams mistakes also were costly in the Rams' 33-26 loss on Sept. 21 to the Philadelphia Eagles, who blocked kicks on Los Angeles' last two possessions -- returning the last for a touchdown on the final play.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers blocked an extra point in the fourth quarter and beat the Rams in overtime in Week 5.\n\nLos Angeles already made changes to the roster, replacing kicker Joshua Karty with Mevis and long snapper Alex Ward with Jake McQuaide.\n\nBlackburn played linebacker in the NFL for 10 seasons for the New York Giants (2005-12) and Carolina Panthers (2013-14). He had 372 career tackles, four interceptions (one returned for a touchdown), 4.5 sacks, six forced fumbles and five fumble recoveries in 132 regular-season games (45 starts).\n\nHe won Super Bowl championships with the Giants in the 2007 and 2011 seasons.\n\n--Field Level Media",

I haven't got everything right as a coach and I put my hand up for that.\"\n\nEngland had one intra-squad match with the England Lions in Perth and opted against further match practice following defeats in Perth and Brisbane.\n\nTheir preparations were similar for other tours, including to India and Pakistan last year.\n\n\"I have been very strong about the conviction we had and our preparation,\" McCullum said.\n\n\"For us, it was a matter of trying to replicate what we have done in series that have been successful for us away from home.\n\n\"Maybe we didn't get that right and I'll acknowledge that.\n\n\"Ultimately you are responsible for how you get your side ready and how you prepare them.\n\n\"We are 3-0 down so you would probably say there was room for change there.\"\n\nMcCullum said England had played much better cricket in the last two days in Adelaide but conceded the tourists had been outplayed in all facets of the game.\n\n\"Credit goes to Australia. They have been as precise as a team as I have seen in the last few years. They put us under pressure throughout,\" he said.\n\n\"We only had fleeting moments in the last three test matches where we felt like we were on top.\n\n\"You accept that and you try to work out ways you can work and identify things you need to make sure to polish up on to give yourself more chance.\"\n\nThe fourth Ashes test starts on December 26 in Melbourne.",

Latham had chalked up 137 and Conway 227 in the first innings.\n\nWest Indies, who trail 1-0 in the three-test series, finished the day on 43 for no loss - still 419 behind their improbable target. Brandon King was batting on 37, while John Campbell was on two.\n\nWest Indies resumed on 381-6 and were all out for 420 in reply to New Zealand's first-innings tally of 575-8 declared.\n\nLatham and Conway, who forged a mammoth stand of 323 in the first innings, once again punished a West Indies attack depleted by a mid-match injury to fast bowler Kemar Roach.\n\nKavem Hodge finally ended the opening partnership at 192 when he had Conway caught by Jayden Seales for 100, a fluent knock that included eight fours and three sixes.\n\nHodge and Seales combined again to remove New Zealand captain Latham, whose 101 included nine fours and two sixes.\n\nKane Williamson made 40 not out and Rachin Ravindra smashed four sixes in his unbeaten 46 before New Zealand declared their second innings on 306-2.\n\n\"It's just making sure we got enough time to bowl them out and then make sure we got some runs on the board that we feel comfortable enough...,\" New Zealand batting coach Luke Ronchi said on the timing of their declaration.\n\n\"We just need to make sure that we bowl the way we know we can bowl and trust ourselves to go out there and we've got 90 overs tomorrow to take 10 wickets.\"\n\nThe West Indies openers demonstrated contrasting approaches in the final 16 overs of the day's play.\n\nKing hit seven fours as he looked to dominate the New Zealand bowlers while Campbell took 21 balls to get off the mark.",

    "content": "ADELAIDE, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Australia swept to an 82-run win in the third Ashes test at Adelaide Oval on Sunday to retain the urn with two matches to spare and leave England facing recriminations over another failed campaign.\n\nChasing a world record 435 runs to win, England battled doggedly on day five but folded for 352, with left-arm quick Mitchell Starc taking three wickets and Scott Boland the last dismissal of Josh Tongue before tea.\n\n\"Three-nil is hugely satisfying for many reasons but particularly with how the chat before the series was how equally poised it was going to be,\" Australia captain Pat Cummins, who took six wickets on his return from a back injury, told reporters\n\n\"This group's amazing at just cracking on.\"Much of the talk in the build-up to the Ashes had been the age profile of the Australia squad but Starc said the veterans had proved their worth.\n\n\"We do laugh at some of the comments that get back to us about how old we are,\" the 35-year-old added.\n\n\"I'm sure experience plays a part going through your highs and lows .... That plays a big part in all of this.\"\n\nAfter eight-wicket defeats in Pert and Brisbane, England have now lost the Ashes in three matches for the fourth consecutive tour, while losing 16 of their last 18 tests in the country.\n\nThough two tests remain, the latest surrender may top the previous tours for sheer disappointment.\n\nThere were expectations of a genuine contest, fighting words from England captain Ben Stokes, and hope that \"Bazball\" might win the urn in Australia for the first time since 2010/11.\n\nAll that was swept aside in Adelaide where England ditched their trademark aggression, reverted to more traditional test batting and were still beaten convincingly.\n\n\"We obviously came here with a goal in mind and we haven't been able to achieve it. It hurts and it sucks,\" said England skipper Stokes.\n\n\"They've been able to outdo us on a much higher level ... I thought we did incredibly well to take us where we did in this fourth innings.\n\n\"We couldn't do what we came here to do but there was some good stuff to come out of this game.\"\n\nOn day five, still needing 228 runs to win, England's hopes were pinned on all-rounder Will Jacks and wicketkeeper Jamie Smith after they resumed on 207 for six.\n\nJacks turned his ankle when pushing off his crease for a run but battled on for 40 minutes until rain halted play.\n\nEngland fans cheered but it was just a passing squall, the ground soon bathed in sunshine.\n\nThe Surrey duo brought up a fifty-run partnership with the old ball and were soon spared spinner Nathan Lyon, who came off with a hamstring injury after cutting off a four in the field.\n\nWhen the second new ball came, Smith attacked with gusto, smashing both Pat Cummins and Starc for back-to-back fours.\n\nBut with the deficit trimmed to 150 runs, he threw the bat at a Starc delivery for a third time in succession and was caught for 60 by a back-pedalling Cummins at mid-on.\n\nJacks played a steadier hand with tailender Carse, who finished 39 not out and hung tough with the all-rounder for 52 runs.\n\nHome fans shifted uncomfortably in their seats as the pair reduced the deficit to under 100 runs but Starc returned and Labuschagne flew in the slips to snuff out the danger.\n\nJacks, on 47, drove at a Starc ball that moved away off the seam and Labuschagne dived to his left for another terrific one-handed catch, having removed Ollie Pope with a screamer in the slips on day four.\n\nJofra Archer then tried to slog Starc but sent the ball down the throat of Jake Weatherald at deep point to leave England one wicket from defeat, before Boland had Tongue sending another slips catch to Labuschagne.\n\nAustralia wicketkeeper Alex Carey was named Man of the Match for a first-innings 106 and 72 in the second, while Head set up the victory with 170 in the third innings, his fourth consecutive test ton at Adelaide Oval.\n\n\"If he wasn't before, he's the king of Adelaide,\" Starc said of Head, who also scored a match-winning 123 in Perth.\n\n\"He's not going to have to pay for another beer (here). I don't know he does it but jeez, it's bloody good to watch.\"",

Williams then hit Moore with the game-winner.\n\nCairo Santos' third field goal of the game, a 43-yarder with 1:59 remaining, pulled Chicago within 16-9.\n\nRomeo Doubs was unable to corral the onside kick and the Bears recovered for a first down at their own 47. Williams then hit a wide-open Walker in the right corner of the end zone.\n\nChicago (11-4) maintained first place in the division over Green Bay (9-5-1), which defeated the Bears 28-21 at home two weeks ago.\n\nWillis, who came on when Jordan Love was injured on a second-quarter sack, directed three scoring drives, including a 33-yard touchdown pass to Doubs that put Green Bay in front 13-3 with 33 seconds left in the third quarter.\n\nSantos answered on the Bears' next possession with a 51-yard field goal to make it 13-6. Brandon McManus countered with a 28-yard field goal to extend the lead to 10 with 5:03 left.\n\nWilliams completed 19 of 34 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns. D'Andre Swift ran for 58 yards and Monangai added 50.\n\nThe Packers ran for 192 yards, including 82 by Emanuel Wilson. Willis completed 9 of 11 passes for 121 yards and also ran for 44 yards. Josh Jacobs was limited to 36 rushing yards on 12 carries. Before he exited, Love completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards.\n\nAfter being blanked in the first half, the Bears got on the board on the opening possession of the third quarter, pulling within 6-3 on Santos' 46-yard field goal. Williams keyed the drive with a 34-yard pass to Monangai.\n\nGreen Bay responded with a drive to the Bears' 3-yard line, but Jacobs' fumble was recovered by Chicago.\n\nWillis came on to replace Love with first down at the Green Bay 32. Willis continued the 16-play, 91-yard drive that ended with McManus' 22-yard field goal that put the Packers in front 6-0 at the half.\n\nMcManus' 26-yarder put Green Bay ahead 3-0 early in the second quarter.\n\nEach team failed on fourth-and-1 inside its 10-yard line on its opening possession.\n\n--Field Level Media",

    "content": "ADELAIDE, Dec 21 (Reuters) - England's dreams of ending their Ashes drought in Australia were shattered on Sunday but captain Ben Stokes said the visitors would look to salvage some pride in the final two matches of the series.\n\nAustralia wrapped up an 82-run win on day five of the third test in Adelaide to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series and retain the urn.\n\nThe loss extended England's wait for a first Ashes series victory since 2015 and has set them up for another humiliation in Australia after suffering 5-0, 4-0 and 4-0 defeats in their last three series Down Under.\n\n\"Obviously that dream that we came here with is now over, which is incredibly disappointing. Everyone's obviously hurting and quite emotional about it,\" Stokes said.\n\n\"We came here with a goal in mind and we've not been able to achieve that and yeah, it hurts and it sucks. But we aren't going to stop.\"\n\nEngland flirted with a comeback for the ages on Sunday, with Will Jacks, Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse putting up brave stands, but Australia's Mitchell Starc took three wickets to end the resistance.\n\n\"Australia's just been able to execute things on a much more consistent basis than us,\" said Stokes when asked where his side had fallen short.\n\n\"They've been able to outdo us, on a much higher level.\n\n\"We showed it in passages in these first three games ... I thought we were on for another heist this morning when Jamie and Will were playing so well. Some of the guys lower down the order stuck in and showed that courage and fight and responsibility that I was asking for.\n\n\"Yes, we've been on the wrong side of the result, but I think we can take a lot from this game into the remaining two games. And I think we've learned a lot about ourselves as a team as well.\"\n\nThe fourth test begins on December 26 in Melbourne, where England will look to head off the chances of a first Ashes whitewash since the 2013-14 series.\n\n\"We aren't going to just fall over and let this series play out. We're going to leave absolutely everything out there on the field,\" Stokes said.\n\n\"We've got people coming over here to watch these last two games. We've got so much more to play for.\"",

Columbia's only other loss this season came at then-No. 3 UConn 89-52 on Nov. 10.\n\nThe Lions are in their first season under coach Kevin Hovde, who was last seen winning a national championship at Florida as an assistant coach last season. He has previous experience at Columbia as a director of basketball operations in 2011 and then as an assistant through the 2015-16 season.\n\nEven with the loss to Stony Brook, Hovde has become the first Columbia coach to win at least nine of his first 11 games since Lou Rossini led the Lions to a 20-0 start in 1950-51.\n\nLed by Kenny Noland's 17.7 points per game and Zinou Eddine Bedri's 7.4 rebounds per contest, Hovde has been impressed with the roster's transition to a new coach after eight straight losing seasons, including 12-15 last year.\n\n\"These guys have done a great job of embracing the process of getting good,\" Hovde recently said to reporters. \"That's what we've talked about: That process of doing the same things every single day and keeping it consistent, keeping it simple. They've done a great job focusing on those things, then going out and executing.\"\n\nCal (11-1) will take its own eight-game winning streak into its final nonconference matchup before tipping off Atlantic Coast Conference play on Dec. 30 at home against 11th-ranked Louisville.\n\nThe winning streak is the Golden Bears' longest in 17 years, while the 11-1 record represents the program's best start since a Pete Newell-coached team opened 28-1 en route to the Final Four in 1960.\n\nChris Bell, who played high school ball at nearby De La Salle High and then in Utah before beginning his college career at Syracuse, is proud to be playing a part in his new school's unusual success.\n\n\"I'm from here, so it's a big thing for me just to see Cal basketball doing good again, and obviously being on the team that's doing it,\" he told the media gathering following a 28-point effort in the Golden Bears' most-recent success, a 97-50 home shellacking of Morgan State on Friday. \"We're super-excited about it, but ... we want to keep pushing and worry about the next game.\"\n\nDai Dai Ames leads Cal with a 17.4 scoring average, followed by John Camden (15.5), Justin Pippen (15.3) and Bell (14.6).

    "content": "December 21 - TCU has won five of its last six games, but for coach Jamie Dixon, there's still room for improvement on the offensive side.\n\nFor the most part, the Horned Frogs (8-3) have taken care of business during their nonconference schedule, but they have struggled to put up big numbers on offense. In their last three games, TCU has averaged 68.6 points per game.\n\nPrior to that, however, TCU produced high offensive outputs, including 85 against Notre Dame, 84 versus 23rd-ranked Florida and 104 against St. Francis (PA).\n\nNow it's just a matter of consistency for the Horned Frogs and they hope it starts when they host Florida A&M (3-6) on Sunday.\n\n\"Offensively we were a little bit better, but we're still not where we want to be,\" Dixon said following the 72-53 win over Oral Roberts on Thursday. \"We just haven't gotten it back to where we were, but we're going to fix it. ... We need to be a little bit better. I think we can be and I know we can be.\n\n\"We haven't shot it great, but we got our transition going last game, didn't get much this game and didn't get the steals we need to get,\" he added. \"We have work to do. There's no question. We have work to do.\"\n\nThe one constant for TCU this season has been the play of David Punch, who is one of five players nationally averaging at least 14 points, seven rebounds, one assist and two blocks per game.\n\nPunch has scored at least 12 points in his last six games, including 17 against Oral Roberts.\n\n\"It's my job to score,\" Punch said. \"It's what I work on and I have to continue to show it and tap into my motor. That's the biggest thing that got me here so why stop using it?\n\n\"We were hungry for a good win,\" he added. \"We've been practicing hard these last couple days and really last couple of weeks so we really wanted this win and show how hard we were working, how hard we've been trying to execute our offense and I feel like we did a pretty decent job.\"\n\nDefensively, TCU continues to wreak havoc with 8.4 steals per game and are forcing 15.8 turnovers per contest. That has resulted in 15.5 fastbreak points per game.\n\nThat defensive intensity will be a test for the Rattlers, who have really struggled against top competition this season. FAMU has lost to South Florida, Kennesaw State, UCF and Georgia this season by an average margin of 30.5 points.\n\nTheir latest loss came at the hands of Tarleton State, a 78-54 defeat on Friday.\n\nFAMU is led offensively by Antonio Baker, who is averaging 11.8 points per game this season. Jordan Chatman is coming off a 17-point performance against Tarleton State. The four-year Rattlers senior is averaging a career-best 10.3 points per game.\n\n--Field Level Media",

    "content": "SYDNEY, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Australia on Sunday was honouring victims of a gun attack a week earlier on a seaside Hanukkah celebration, as the prime minister announced a review of the country's law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\nThe nation was marking a day of reflection to honour the 15 people killed and the dozens wounded in the attack by two gunmen at Sydney's Bondi Beach. With security tight and flags at half-staff on government buildings, a minute of silence was to be held at 6:47 p.m. (0747 GMT), the time the attack began.\n\nAuthorities invited Australians to light a candle on Sunday evening, the start of the eighth and final day of the Jewish festival of lights, \"as a quiet act of remembrance with family, friends or loved ones\" of the victims of the attack, allegedly carried out by a father and son.\n\nAn evening memorial event at Bondi Beach will take place under a heavy police presence, including officers carrying long-arm firearms, police said in a statement.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the review, to be led by a former chief of Australia's spy agency, would probe whether federal police and intelligence agencies have the \"right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe\".\n\nThe attack exposed gaps in gun-license assessments and information-sharing between agencies that policymakers have said they want to plug. Albanese has announced a nationwide gun buyback, while gun safety experts say the nation's gun laws, among the world's toughest, are riddled with loopholes.\n\nThe authorities are investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism targeting Jews. Patrols and policing across the country have been ramped up to prevent further antisemitic violence. Authorities believe the gunmen were inspired by militant Sunni Muslim group Islamic State.\n\n\"The ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation. Our security agencies must be in the best position to respond,\" Albanese said in a statement, adding that the review would conclude by the end of April.\n\nAlbanese, under pressure from critics who say his centre-left government has not done enough to curb a surge in antisemitism since the start of the war in Gaza, has vowed to strengthen hate laws in the wake of the attack.\n\nThe Bondi Beach attack was the most serious of a string of antisemitic incidents in Australia, which have included attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars, since Israel launched the war in October 2023, in response to an attack by Hamas.\n\nAlbanese condemned anti-immigration rallies being held in Sydney and Melbourne on Sunday.\n\n\"There are organised rallies seeking to sow division in the aftermath of last Sunday’s antisemitic terrorist attack, and they have no place in Australia,\" he said in a statement. \"They should not go ahead and people should not attend them.”\n\nOnly about 50 people were at the Sydney rally by mid-afternoon, according to a Reuters witness.\n\nOn Saturday, the government of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, pledged to introduce a bill on Monday to ban the display of symbols and flags of \"terrorist organisations\", including those of Islamic State, Hamas, al-Qaeda, Al Shabaab, Boko Haram and Hezbollah.\n\nAuthorities say Islamic State flags were found in the car the alleged attackers took to Bondi.\n\nAlleged gunman Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene. His 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, who was also shot by police and emerged from a coma on Tuesday, has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, according to police. He remains in custody in hospital.",

The Pelicans were 29-of-34 at the charity stripe as a team, getting to the line effectively behind an aggressive attack of the rim that also produced 70 points in the paint.\n\nDerik Queen led the Pelicans with 10 rebounds and scored 17 points for his second double-double in as many contests.

The win is Vancouver's fourth straight on a five-game trip.\n\nAlso for the Canucks, Linus Karlsson registered his first career two-goal game and added an assist, and Max Sasson also scored.\n\nMorgan Geekie had a goal and an assist, while Pavel Zacha, Tanner Jeannot and Andrew Peeke also lit the lamp for Boston, which is 1-2-1 in its last four games and lost its first game in extra time this season.\n\nPeeke's point shot in off the post with 3:44 left forced overtime.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 18 stops in his fourth straight start for Boston, which had a 42-22 advantage in shots including 13-4 in the first period and 6-2 in overtime.\n\nBoston turned a dominant start into a 1-0 lead, as Geekie buried a one-timer from the left circle for a power-play goal at 11:37. Geekie became the third Bruin to reach the 25-goal milestone before the holiday break, joining Hockey Hall of Fame member Phil Esposito and Geekie's current teammate David Pastrnak.\n\nSasson brought the visitors even with 15 seconds left in the first, scoring a wrist shot from the slot off Ohgren's centering feed.\n\nVancouver's power play flipped the score 4:22 into the second period.

Karlsson snapped off a shot from high on the left circle at 3:53.\n\nOhgren redirected Pettersson's drive from the center point to lift Vancouver at the 7:34 mark. But Vancouver being unable to convert on overlapping power plays, including a short 5-on-3 halfway through the third, helped set up Peeke's goal.\n\n--Field Level Media",

Nashville's Juuse Saros stopped 19 of 22 shots.\n\nBobby McMann tallied two points for Toronto with a goal and an assists and Woll turned away 29 of 32 shots.\n\nThe Leafs opened the scoring 1:32 into the game. McMann caught Predators defenseman Nick Perbix cheating toward the slot on an odd-man rush, then fed Nicolas Roy in front of the net, who had no trouble tipping it over Saros' glove.\n\nNashville found its equalizer early in the second period. Erik Haula caught a piece of Roman Josi's low-streaking one-timer from the point on the power play. Haula pulled off the deft redirect all with his back turned toward the goal.\n\nJohn Tavares proceeded to snap a seven-game goalless streak with something more of an inadvertent deflection. Matias Maccelli's soft flick from the point tipped off Tavares' skate and then Josi's before sliding past a befuddled Saros. This game marked Maccelli's first since he was made a healthy scratch in November -- the primary assist marked his first point since Nov. 22.\n\nThe Predators knotted it at two apiece with 34 seconds remaining in the second period. Woll narrowly beat Filip Forsberg to a long breakaway pass, but the clearing attempt went only as far as Ryan O'Reilly at the blue line. O'Reilly fed an on-rushing Adam Wilsby for his first of the year and the second of his 47-game NHL career.\n\nAfter Evangelista put the Predators ahead 3-1 with 9:18 left in the third period, Stamkos bagged his empty-netter off a neutral-zone turnover 40 seconds. McMann then brought the deficit back within one off a difficult wrist shot. Cole Smith replied with another empty-netter with less than 10 seconds remaining for the two-goal advantage.\n\nNashville whiffed on consecutive open-net opportunities in close succession in the third. Josi received a slick pass through the slot, only to slip it through the legs of Woll and wide of the goal. O'Reilly managed only to hit the side of the net off a Troy Stecher blocked shot with Woll sliding in the wrong direction.\n\nThe Leafs are at the bottom of the Atlantic Division, having now lost four of their last five.\n\n--Field Level Media",

    "title": "US Epstein files full of famous names, but not Trump's",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The thousands of documents released by the U.S. Justice Department related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were filled with the names of some of the world's most famous people, including former President Bill Clinton, but there was one notable exception: President Donald Trump.\n\nThe department released only a partial tranche of the Epstein-related documents in its possession on Friday with much of the information within them redacted, citing the extensive effort required in reviewing the materials and the need to protect Epstein's victims.\n\nTrump's administration was attempting to comply with a law overwhelmingly passed by Congress in November that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein files, despite Trump's months-long effort to keep them sealed.\n\nThe extensive redactions and the limited number of documents released angered some Republicans and did little to defuse a scandal threatening the party ahead of 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe absence of references to Trump was notable given that pictures and documents related to him have trickled out of previous Epstein releases for years. Trump's name appeared in flight manifests listing passengers on Epstein's private plane that were part of a first batch of Epstein material the Justice Department released in February, for instance.\n\nThe release also contained other items of note, including a complaint accusing Epstein of involvement in \"child pornography\" that was filed with the FBI in 1996, long before law enforcement began looking into his misconduct.\n\nCelebrities who appeared in photos made available as part of Friday's release include the late news anchor Walter Cronkite, singers Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, British entrepreneur Richard Branson and the former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson. Many of the photos were undated and provided without context, and none of those figures have been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor also appears in one photo lying across the laps of several women. The former Duke of York, who was stripped of his royal title over his ties to Epstein, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe scandal surrounding Epstein has become a political wound for Trump, who for years had promoted conspiracy theories about Epstein to his supporters.\n\nThe material released this week included evidence from several investigations into Epstein, along with photos of Clinton, long scorned by Republicans. But they appeared to include few if any photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein's well-publicized friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s before they had a falling out prior to Epstein's first conviction in 2008.\n\nTrump has not been accused of wrongdoing and has denied knowing about Epstein's crimes.\n\nOne file with a photo of Trump appeared to have been removed on Saturday from the dataset released by the Justice Department. Its absence was noted online by Democrats in the House of Representatives, who demanded an explanation from the administration.\n\nLater on Saturday, that picture was part of up to 16 photos that had been deleted from the Justice Department website, according to The New York Times, NPR and the Associated Press.\n\nThe Justice Department and the White House did not immediately respond to queries about missing files.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how substantive the new materials were, given that many Epstein-related documents have previously been made public since his 2019 death in jail, which was ruled a suicide.\n\nMany of the files were heavily redacted — several documents with 100 pages or more were entirely blacked out — and the Justice Department acknowledged it was still reviewing hundreds of thousands of additional pages for possible release.\n\nOne of Epstein's victims, Marina Lacerda, reacted angrily on Saturday to the large number of redactions and unreleased documents.\n\n\"All of us are infuriated by this. It's another slap in the face. We expected way more,\" Lacerda told MS NOW.\n\nLast month, Democrats in the House released thousands of emails obtained from Epstein's estate, including one in which Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls,\" without clarifying what that meant. Trump, in response, accused Democrats of promoting the \"Epstein Hoax\" as a distraction.\n\nThe Justice Department sought to draw attention to Clinton, with two agency spokespeople posting on social media images that they said showed him with Epstein victims.\n\nClinton's deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said in a statement that the White House was attempting to \"shield themselves\" from scrutiny by focusing on the former president.\n\n\"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said the release demonstrated its transparency and commitment to justice for Epstein's victims. But the disclosures occurred only because Congress forced the administration's hand, after Trump officials declared earlier this year that no more Epstein files would be made public.\n\nThe disclosure law required the Justice Department to turn over information about its handling of the Epstein investigation, including internal reports and emails. None of those materials appeared to be in the batch of documents the government released on Friday.\n\nThe law allowed the Justice Department to withhold personal information about Epstein's victims as well as material that would jeopardize an active investigation.",

He was a contributor in the Oklahoma State rotation early on, starting the first three games and averaging 3.7 points and 4.0 rebounds over 13 minutes a game.\n\n\"It's incredibly disappointing for Rob because of how hard he's worked to get himself back on the court,\" Oklahoma State coach Steve Lutz said in a statement. \"He had surgery in the offseason to correct an issue with his hip, but unfortunately, it hasn't responded the way we had hoped. After consulting with our medical staff, we've decided to shut him down for the season with the goal of getting him back to full strength. We're certainly going to miss him on the floor, but Rob will continue to lead and support this team in a big way behind the scenes.\"\n\nJennings played in all 35 games last season. He also played two seasons at Texas Tech.\n\nThe Cowboys did get freshman center Benjamin Ahmed on the court for the first time in Thursday's 91-79 win over Kansas City.

    "content": "December 21 - The Minnesota Timberwolves are coming off their biggest win of the season.\n\nNow, the challenge is to avoid an emotional letdown in their follow-up performance.\n\nMinnesota will go for back-to-back victories when it tips off against the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday evening in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves have won three of their past four games, including a 112-107 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday night.\n\nThe Timberwolves scored the final eight points of the game to edge the defending NBA champion Thunder, who lost for only the third time this season.\n\nTimberwolves forward Naz Reid said he and his teammates needed to harness that win as they turned their attention to the Bucks.\n\n\"Having a game like that against the No. 1 team in the West, potentially the best team in the league, it's exciting,\" Reid said. \"It's good. We've got to have the mindset and determination to follow that game moving on.\"\n\nTeammate Anthony Edwards agreed. By the time Edwards sat in front of his locker to conduct a postgame interview on Friday, his mind already was focused on the team's next test.\n\n\"That's just one win, man,\" Edwards said. \"It's a regular-season win. Like I said, they're the best team in the league -- by far. We've got to keep doing it.\"\n\nThey will go up against a short-handed Bucks team that is without star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf) and role player Taurean Prince (neck). Veteran scorer Kyle Kuzma (illness) is expected to return to the lineup after missing the team's 111-105 home defeat to the Toronto Raptors on Thursday.\n\nMilwaukee has lost back-to-back games and four of its past five. The Bucks stayed competitive in their most recent contest against the Raptors.\n\nBucks coach Doc Rivers is taking a big-picture approach to the team's recent struggles.\n\n\"I think we're getting closer,\" Rivers said. \"I think we're starting to figure it out -- and we're not there, (if) I'm being honest -- on who plays best in the non-Giannis minutes. That's something, if we can get Giannis back healthy for the rest of the year, I think it will serve well for us.\"\n\nIn the meantime, other players have tried to step forward for the Bucks.\n\nKevin Porter Jr. scored 22 points and dished 13 assists on Thursday, but he also committed seven turnovers. Jericho Sims had six points and seven boards with four turnovers, and Ryan Rollins scored 17 points off the bench with three steals and three turnovers.\n\n\"The guys are trying,\" Rivers said. \"They want to win. The problem is, by doing that, they did too much. ... When we have guys out, we have no margin of error.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota is getting closer to full health. Mike Conley (Achilles) and Jaylen Clark (illness) did not play Friday, but Edwards returned from a foot injury and proved critical on both ends of the court in the closing minutes. Conley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game.\n\nEdwards leads the team with 28.5 points per game on 49.8% shooting. Julius Randle is next with 22.9 points per game to go along with 7.2 rebounds and a team-best 5.7 assists per game.\n\nEdwards also praised Rudy Gobert (team-high 10.6 rebounds per game) for taking on a more prominent role on offense in recent games. It is something that could continue Sunday against Milwaukee.\n\n\"I told him, 'You keep making plays, I'm going to keep trusting you,'\" Edwards said.\n\n--Field Level Media",

    "content": "December 21 - When the Winnipeg Jets face the Utah Mammoth on Sunday in Salt Lake City, both teams enter the matchup looking to improve their position in the Western Conference standings.\n\nWinnipeg has struggled over the last month, with just three victories in its last 15 games.\n\nThe Jets are coming off a 3-2 loss to the first-place Colorado Avalanche on Friday night. While the effort showed improvement, the result meant two more lost points in the standings. After a 9-3-0 start to the season, Winnipeg now sits two points out of last place in the league.\n\n\"There was a lot more battle, a lot more compete. ... That was a better effort than the last one,\" Jets coach Scott Arniel said after Friday's defeat in Denver. \"But we've got to find a way to get over that hump of winning those games. Right now, we're a delicate, fragile group and we're finding ways to lose games.\"\n\nSlow starts have been a recurring issue for Winnipeg. Against Colorado, the Jets again allowed two first-period goals to put themselves in a hole. Winnipeg is 2-13-1 when giving up the first goal and has been outshot by 30 in opening periods this season.\n\n\"Just kind of put yourself in a tough spot, that's a tough team to chase,\" said Jets forward Morgan Barron. \"Yeah, gotta find a way to not put ourselves in those holes. ... That's the frustrating part, it's kind of been our Achilles heel... if it's a one-goal game, we just can't kind of find that extra juice to squeeze two points out of it.\"\n\nSunday's game is important for both teams. The Jets trail Utah by five points in the standings, but they have three games in hand. Both clubs are currently outside the playoff picture, though the Mammoth are tied on points with San Jose for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.\n\nUtah has fallen out of a playoff position since losing forward Logan Cooley to a lower-body injury sustained against Vancouver on Dec. 5. Cooley is not expected to return to the lineup before February.\n\nThe Mammoth dropped three consecutive games following his injury, but since have shown signs of recovery. Utah has won three of its last five games despite a 2-1 loss Friday at home to the New Jersey Devils.\n\n\"We did a lot of good stuff,' said coach Andre Tourigny on Friday. \"Dominated scoring, chances, shots, things like that. But, at the same time... we had an opportunity to put the game away when we had the lead and could not score the big goal or take advantage of our opportunity.\"\n\nClose contests have been a calling card for Utah this season, but the Mammoth are near the bottom of the league in one-goal games. They're just 7-6-3 in those situations.\n\n\"One play kind of makes a difference,\" said Utah forward Alexander Kerfoot on the defeat to New Jersey. \"We had some looks... tie it up, but I thought overall, it was a pretty good hockey game, but they just made one more play than we did.\"\n\n--Field Level Media",

    "content": "Dec 20 (Reuters) - The United States has intercepted an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Saturday, a move that comes just days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a \"blockade\" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.\n\nIt’s the second time in recent weeks that the United States has gone after a tanker near Venezuela amid a large U.S. military build-up in the region.\n\nNoem confirmed the Coast Guard intercepted a tanker that was last docked in Venezuela.\n\n\"The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,\" she said in a statement posted to social media. \"We will find you, and we will stop you.\"\n\nThree U.S. officials earlier Saturday had told Reuters that the vessel had been intercepted.\n\nThe Coast Guard and Pentagon referred questions to the White House.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said the tanker contained sanctioned oil.\n\n\"It was a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime,\" she wrote on X.\n\nVenezuela's oil ministry and state oil company PDVSA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe Venezuelan government called the tanker interception a \"serious act of international piracy.\"\n\nVenezuela \"denounces and rejects the theft and hijacking of a new private vessel transporting oil, as well as the forced disappearance of its crew, committed by military personnel of the United States of America in international waters,\" the statement said.\n\nCaracas said the actions will be reported to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral organizations and governments.\n\nBritish maritime risk management company Vanguard said the vessel was believed to be the Panama-flagged Centuries, which was intercepted east of Barbados in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nJeremy Paner, a partner at Washington, D.C., law firm Hughes Hubbard and a former OFAC investigator, said the vessel has not been sanctioned by the U.S.\n\n\"The seizure of a vessel that is not sanctioned by the U.S. marks a further increase in Trump’s pressure on Venezuela,\" Paner said. \"It also runs counter to Trump’s statement that the U.S. would impose a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers.\"\n\nTrump on Tuesday said he was ordering \"A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela.\"\n\nIn the days since U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week, there has been an effective embargo in place, with loaded vessels carrying millions of barrels of oil staying in Venezuelan waters rather than risk seizure.\n\nSince the first seizure, Venezuelan crude exports have fallen sharply.\n\nWhile many vessels picking up oil in Venezuela are under sanctions, others transporting the country's oil and crude from Iran and Russia have not been sanctioned, and some companies, particularly the U.S.' Chevron (CVX.N), opens new tab, transport Venezuelan oil in their own authorized ships.\n\nChina is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for roughly 4% of its imports, with shipments in December on track to average more than 600,000 barrels per day, analysts have said.\n\nFor now, the oil market is well supplied and there are millions of barrels of oil on tankers off the coast of China waiting to offload. If the embargo stays in place for some time, then the loss of nearly a million barrels a day of crude supply is likely to push oil prices higher.\n\nSince the U.S. imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela in 2019, traders and refiners buying Venezuelan oil have resorted to a \"shadow fleet\" of tankers that disguise their location and to vessels sanctioned for transporting Iranian or Russian oil.\n\nThe dark or shadow fleet is considered exposed to possible punitive measures from the U.S., shipping analysts have said.\n\nCenturies, which loaded in Venezuela under the false name \"Crag\" and is part of the dark fleet, was carrying some 1.8 million barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude oil bound for China, according to internal documents from state oil company PDVSA, the oil's seller.\n\nThe vessel departed Venezuelan waters on Wednesday after being briefly escorted by the Venezuelan navy, according to company sources and satellite images obtained by TankerTrackers.com.\n\nThe crude was bought by Satau Tijana Oil Trading, one of many intermediaries involved in PDVSA's sales to Chinese independent refiners, the documents showed.\n\nAs of this week, of more than 70 oil tankers in Venezuelan waters that are part of the shadow fleet, around 38 are under sanctions by the U.S. Treasury, according to data from TankerTrackers.com. Of those, at least 15 are loaded with crude and fuel, it added.\n\nTrump's pressure campaign on Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near Venezuela, which have killed at least 100 people.\n\nTrump has also said that U.S. land strikes on the South American country will soon start.\n\nVenezuela's Maduro has alleged that the U.S. military build-up is aimed at overthrowing him and gaining control of the OPEC nation's oil resources, which are the world's largest crude reserves.",

Houston scored 19 points off 12 Arkansas turnovers.\n\nFreshman guard Darius Acuff Jr. posted game highs of 27 points and seven assists to pace the Razorbacks (9-3). Ewin tallied 20 points and grabbed nine rebounds for Arkansas, but he finished 10 of 17 from the free-throw line. Four of those misses came late in the first half as the Razorbacks attempted to claw back from a 40-19 deficit.\n\nA spate of Arkansas turnovers fueled the Cougars' surge to a double-digit lead midway through the first half. Flemings recorded back-to-back steals that yielded baskets, with Ramon Walker Jr. (12 points off the bench) following the first Flemings steal with a second-chance putback before Flemings converted a layup for a 28-17 lead at the 11:59 mark.\n\nArkansas attempted to stop the bleeding with a timeout, but Joseph Tugler forced another turnover and scored on the other end as Houston capped its 15-0 run to take a 34-17 lead. Acuff stalled that rally with a pair of free throws that ignited a Razorbacks response. His 3-point play with 6:36 left in the half shaved the deficit to 10 and, while the Cougars missed 8 of 9 shots, Arkansas sliced a 21-point deficit to single digits.\n\nWhen Acuff attacked the rim for a layup with three seconds left, Arkansas trailed 49-41 at the half. Acuff and Ewin combined for 26 first-half points to keep the Razorbacks within range.\n\n--Field Level Media",
