Frank Nazar assisted on both tallies.\n\nTrevor Moore scored and Darcy Kuemper made 34 saves for the Kings, who have lost two in a row.\n\nEarly in the second period, the Blackhawks went on their second power play when Joel Edmundson was called for tripping Andre Burakovsky.

    "title": "Supreme Court revives pro-Republican Texas voting map sought by Trump",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court revived on Thursday a redrawn Texas electoral map designed to add more Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives, boosting President Donald Trump's quest for his party to keep control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe court, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, issued the ruling amid a nationwide battle unfolding in Republican-governed and Democratic-led states involving the redrawing of electoral maps to change the composition of congressional districts for partisan advantage.\n\nA lower court that had blocked Texas from using the map concluded it likely was racially discriminatory in violation of U.S. constitutional protections.\n\nThe reinstated map - sought by Trump, approved in August by the Republican-led state legislature and signed by Republican Governor Greg Abbott - could flip as many as five currently Democratic-held U.S. House seats to Republicans. Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Texas Republicans cheered the ruling. Texas Democrats called it an affront to democracy, and the Supreme Court's three liberal justices dissented from the court's action, which came in an unsigned order.\n\nRepublicans currently hold slim majorities in both chambers of Congress. Ceding control of either the House or Senate to the Democrats in the November 2026 elections would endanger Trump's legislative agenda and open the door to Democratic-led congressional investigations targeting the president.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted a request by Texas officials to lift the lower court's ruling blocking the map.\n\n\"The District Court improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections,\" the court said in a brief opinion explaining the decision.\n\nThe court in the order, acknowledging the political aims of Texas to benefit the Republican Party, also said the lower court mistakenly did not fault the new map's challengers for not themselves producing \"a viable alternative map that met the state's avowedly partisan goals.\"\n\nLiberal Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court's majority, saying it disrespected the work of the lower court, whose ruling actually was authored by a judge appointed by Trump.\n\n\"We are a higher court than the district court, but we are not a better one when it comes to making such a fact-based decision,\" Kagan wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n\"This court's stay guarantees that Texas's new map, with all its enhanced partisan advantage, will govern next year's elections for the House of Representatives. And this court's stay ensures that many Texas citizens, for no good reason, will be placed in electoral districts because of their race. And that result, as this court has pronounced year in and year out, is a violation of the Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.\n\nDemocratic-governed California reacted to the Texas redistricting by initiating its own effort targeting five Republican-held districts in the state. California voters in November overwhelmingly approved a new map beneficial to Democrats. The Trump administration has sued California to try to stop its new congressional map from taking effect.\n\nRepublicans in the Indiana state House of Representatives are expected on Friday to approve a new map targeting the state's only two Democratic U.S. House members. It is unclear whether the map has enough support to pass the Republican-controlled state Senate.\n\nOther states including Republican-led North Carolina, Missouri and Florida and Democratic-led Virginia and Maryland have either passed new maps or are considering doing so.\n\nRepublican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, lauding the Supreme Court's ruling, said that \"Texas is paving the way as we take our country back, district by district, state by state.\"\n\n\"This map reflects the political climate of our state and is a massive win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits,\" Paxton said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in Texas expressed anger.\n\n\"The Supreme Court failed Texas voters today, and they failed American democracy. This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won't protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,\" said Gene Wu, the Democratic State House minority leader, referring to the landmark 1965 U.S. law that barred racial discrimination in voting.\n\n\"Latino and Black voters are being punished for how we vote, plain and simple,\" State Representative Ramón Romero Jr. said.\n\nRedrawing the boundaries of electoral districts in a state is a process called redistricting. There have been legal fights at the Supreme Court for decades over a practice called gerrymandering - the redrawing of district boundaries in order to marginalize a certain set of voters and increase the influence of others.\n\nThe Supreme Court in a 2019 ruling declared that gerrymandering for partisan reasons - to boost the electoral chances of one's own party and weaken one's political opponent - cannot be challenged in federal courts. Gerrymandering driven primarily by race remains unlawful under the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law and 15th Amendment prohibition on racial discrimination in voting.\n\nMany Texas Republican lawmakers have said the new map was devised in response to Trump's request to redraw electoral maps for a partisan advantage in House races. But the El Paso-based court ruled 2-1 on November 18 that the map likely amounted to an unlawful racial gerrymander, siding with civil rights groups that sued to block it.\n\nEach of the 50 U.S. states is represented in Congress by two U.S. senators, with representation in the 435-seat House based on population. California, the most-populous state, has the most House members with 52, while Texas is second with 38. Republicans currently hold 25 of 38 U.S. House seats in Texas.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who authored the lower court's ruling, wrote that \"what ultimately spurred\" Texas to redraw its map was a letter from the U.S. Justice Department urging state officials to \"inject racial considerations into what Texas insists was a race-blind process.\"\n\nBrown, a Trump judicial appointee, wrote that the Justice Department's analysis was based on the \"legally incorrect assertion\" that the racial composition of four Texas congressional districts in the state's previous electoral map was unconstitutional and that they must be redrawn.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito on November 21 had temporarily paused the lower court's ruling as the Supreme Court weighed how to proceed with the case.\n\nThe NAACP civil rights group noted in a statement after the lower court's ruling that \"the state of Texas is only 40% white, but white voters control over 73% of the state's congressional seats.\"\n\nRedistricting generally occurs to reflect population changes as measured by the national census conducted each decade, though this year's redistricting has been motivated by securing partisan advantage.",

    "title": "World Cup theatre, F1 brinkmanship and Ashes tension light up the week ahead",
    "content": "Coming up this week: a Trump-tinged World Cup draw in Washington, a three-way F1 title shootout in Abu Dhabi, and the Ashes returning to the Gabbatoir for a day-night test that could shape the series.\n\nSOCCER\n\nTiny debutants will share the stage with football giants at Friday’s World Cup draw in Washington, but the real story is the Trump-tinged spectacle — the draw will be held in the now Trump-run Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. — and the vast challenge of staging an expanded 48-team tournament across three countries in peak North American summer.\n\nThe sport’s governing body touts what is poised to be its biggest-ever tournament as a breakthrough for inclusion, with first-timers like Cape Verde, Uzbekistan, Jordan and tiny Curaçao joining the party, and long-absent Haiti returning. Yet the feel-good narrative is tempered by hard limits: more matches, more miles, and more exposure to heat that can punish even the fittest squads.\n\nHeat was already a central concern during the Club World Cup run earlier this year. Many U.S. cities hosting games routinely hit the high 30s Celsius (that’s pushing the 100s, for Fahrenheit-loving Americans) in June and July, with humidity and thunderstorms thrown in. FIFA points to retractable-roof venues in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Vancouver as mitigations, but most fixtures will unfold outdoors, where cooling systems don’t exist, and the sun has the final say.\n\nBroadcast demands add another layer of complexity. European and Asian markets want matches at watchable hours, which can translate to mid-afternoon kick-offs in North America — the hottest slot of the day. Balancing commercial needs and player safety is now one of FIFA’s thorniest tasks. The draw will determine the groupings, but more decisive information — such as kick-off times and travel patterns — won’t be announced until Saturday.\n\nPolitics shadow the event as well. Donald Trump’s return to the White House has raised questions about visas, cross-border coordination and general security for a tournament reliant on smooth movement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Iran have threatened to boycott the draw over visa allocations, a reminder that global competitions rarely escape geopolitics, no matter how carefully scripted.\n\nFor the debutants and heavyweights alike, the real anxiety may lie less in prospective opponents and more in the environmental and logistical path ahead. Heat, flight distances and recovery gaps could shape tactics and squad rotation as much as any tactical matchup. FIFA boss Gianni Infantino calls this the “most inclusive World Cup ever.” It may also be the one where survival skills matter just as much as footballing pedigree.\n\nFIFA World Cup draw and city allocation, Washington, D.C, USA — December 5-6\n\nFORMULA ONE\n\nThe Formula One season ends in Abu Dhabi this weekend with three drivers still in title contention — a first since 2010, when there were four hopefuls, with Sebastian Vettel ultimately crowned champion.\n\nThis time around it is McLaren leading the way with Lando Norris 12 points clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen and McLaren's Oscar Piastri the outsider, a further four behind.\n\nThe Australian is hoping to do a Vettel and take the title from third overall, but it's a long shot. While Norris will be Britain's 11th champion if he finishes on the podium, McLaren are feeling the heat after a double disqualification in Las Vegas followed by a glaring strategy error in Qatar.\n\nSurely they can't bungle it for a third race in a row?\n\nThis is new territory for Norris and Piastri, whereas Verstappen has been there — for the last four years — and has nothing to lose.\n\nExpect drama, delight and disappointment in equal measure.\n\nThe race is also Ferrari's last chance to win in a barren season and Lewis Hamilton's final attempt at a top-three finish in what would otherwise be the seven times world champion's first season without a podium. It doesn't look like happening, given the Briton's dismal recent run of form.\n\nAbu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix — November 5-7\n\nCRICKET\n\nThe Ashes is back with the second test, a day-nighter, at Brisbane's Gabba ground, sometimes known as the \"graveyard of English cricket\" or the \"Gabbatoir.”\n\nEngland's coach Brendon \"Baz\" McCullum and captain Ben Stokes have already insisted that they will not be changing their aggressive \"Bazball\" approach to batting despite losing the series opener inside two dramatic days in Perth.\n\nAustralia will be again without skipper Pat Cummins as he returns from a back injury. But in left-arm quick Mitchell Starc they have one of the most lethal performers with the pink ball, which is used instead of the red ball in day-night tests for better visibility under the floodlights.\n\nA furious debate in the local media about who will open for Australia is now a standard pre-match ritual, and 38-year-old Usman Khawaja lost out due to back problems.\n\nEngland last conquered Brisbane's pace and bounce in 1986. The team desperately needs to leave the Gabba without a loss to avoid falling further behind in the five-match series.\n\nAshes Series, second test, Brisbane, Australia — December 4-8\n\nEXTRA TIME\n\nSoccer: Lionel Messi and Thomas Müller rekindle one of football’s great modern duels on an unlikely stage on Saturday, when Inter Miami face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the MLS Cup final. Messi arrives as Golden Boot winner and likely MVP; Müller as Vancouver’s late-season catalyst, hauling the Canadians to their first final just months after joining. The showdown caps a year of upheaval for MLS — from a shift to an August-to-May calendar to Apple TV dropping its paywall — as North America prepares to host the World Cup. For two old rivals, it is one more shot at silverware and one more chapter in a feud that endures.\n\nNFL: A long-dormant rivalry roars back to life on Sunday at Lambeau Field as the NFC North-leading Chicago Bears (9-3) visit the Green Bay Packers (8-3) in a showdown that could shape the division race and even the NFC playoff seeding. The storied foes, who first met in 1921, have not shared a genuinely meaningful game in years — but that changes as they battle for top spot. Elsewhere, the red-hot Denver Broncos (10-2), riding a nine-game winning streak behind an elite defence, visit the struggling Las Vegas Raiders aiming to edge closer to their first AFC West title since 2015.\n\nGolf: Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy brings a bit of genuine star quality to Royal Melbourne Golf Club for the 108th Australian Open tournament. Five-times major champion McIlroy has already had his name etched on the Stonehaven Cup after beating Adam Scott in a playoff in 2013 to join Greg Norman, Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Peter Thomson in winning Australia's oldest and most prestigious golf prize. The days when the likes of Nicklaus regularly made the long trip Down Under are now gone and organisers will mostly be looking for a return to clarity after a confused few years where the men's, women's and all-abilities championships were staged in one mega-tournament.\n\nLuge: The luge World Cup belatedly kicks off in Germany this weekend after track issues wiped out the Innsbruck opener, with athletes boosted by an early test — and Olympic qualifier — on Cortina’s 2026 track. Germany dominated that event as expected, led by Merle Fraebel, Julia Taubitz and their doubles teams, though Austria hit back through Jonas Mueller and a team-relay win. That rivalry should shape a condensed World Cup opening round featuring all five disciplines, including the newer mixed events, across three straight days with 19 nations involved. Germany, in its various forms, have won 32 of 52 Olympic titles since the sport’s 1964 debut — and remain the benchmark.\n\nRugby: After a feast of November internationals, attention shifts to the European Champions Cup, which kicks off this weekend with French clubs chasing a sixth straight title and looking strong favourites again. Toulouse open at home to the Sharks with Antoine Dupont back after nine months out, while holders Bordeaux Bègles travel to the Bulls.

    "content": "BEIJING, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Chinese leader Xi Jinping accompanied French President Emmanuel Macron to Chengdu on Friday, a rare gesture seemingly reserved for the head of Europe's second-largest economy that highlights Beijing's focus on Paris in its ties with the European Union.\n\nEven when U.S. President Donald Trump made a landmark visit to China early during his first term in 2017, and Xi lavished him with a private dinner within Beijing's Forbidden City, the trip was confined to the Chinese capital.\n\nBut despite the apparent bonhomie between Xi and Macron, the French president's visit so far has resulted in little beyond bolstering Beijing's diplomatic credentials, as world leaders turn to China seeking economic assurances due to Trump's tariffs, analysts say. It has also provided Macron with a chance to project statesmanship after a tough summer in domestic politics.\n\nInvestors are watching to see whether a day that began with the French president surprising fellow joggers in the city's Jincheng Lake Park, before joining Xi at a historic dam site, will end with major commercial deals or a thaw in EU-China trade tensions, given that Macron has been joined on his fourth state visit to China by the heads of some of France's biggest firms.\n\nA meeting in the Chinese capital on Thursday only resulted in 12 cooperation agreements covering areas such as population ageing, nuclear energy and panda conservation, and no monetary total was disclosed.\n\n\"I think they (France) thought that Xi would be in a position to offer a lot because Europe is really preparing this economic security doctrine,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, senior fellow at the think tank Bruegel.\n\n\"Macron probably felt that given his weight and the fact that France is clearly the one that is pushing the most on economic security, that they would get a deal, but nope.\"\n\nBeijing may see friendly ties with France as a way into expanding its influence within the 27-strong EU, but is very constrained in its ability to offer Paris major concessions.\n\nThe Chinese leader was not expected to sign off on a long-anticipated 500-jet Airbus order, for example, as that would reduce China's leverage in trade talks with the U.S., which is pressing for new Boeing commitments.\n\nXi is also unlikely to ease conditions for French cognac makers or pork producers, as doing so would weaken Beijing's negotiating position with Brussels over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nNor can Xi offer Macron a breakthrough on the war in Ukraine for him to take back to Europe, with China having recently reaffirmed its support for Russia.\n\nRecent visits by Spain's King Felipe VI and German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil were similarly low on tangible outcomes.\n\nChinese government advisers say Beijing feels it has the upper hand and is waiting for Brussels to yield and accept a minimum price plan for its EVs rather than the tariffs currently levied on them.\n\n\"They (the EU) now recognise the complexity of the issue. After Trump became president again, they realised they are too dependent on the U.S.... Europe is now in need of more reciprocal trade with China,\" one advisor said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak with media.\n\n\"The EU should really reflect on its China policy and not tie it too closely to Russia and Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nXi also did not raise the prospect of a trade deal with the EU with Macron - which China's top diplomat Wang Yi brought up when Estonia's foreign minister visited last month and the Chinese commerce ministry has touted - despite talks over a landmark EU-China investment pact having been frozen since 2021.\n\nThe vote on whether to adopt the European Commission's EV tariffs divided the member states, with France voting in favour of the duties while Germany, Europe's biggest economy, voted against.\n\nChina could seek to exploit such divisions.\n\n\"It is interesting that they (China) keep raising it (a trade deal) with the member states,\" said a European Commission official. \"We have no plans whatsoever to have any kind of trade agreement with China,\" they added, also requesting anonymity.",

    "content": "MUMBAI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Indian rupee forward premiums dropped on Friday following the central bank's rate cut and forex swap, though currency traders say a softer spot trajectory should cap the downside.\n\nIn the interbank order-matching system, the November 2026 forward premium fell to 1.91 rupees from 2.18 rupees before the Reserve Bank of India's policy decision, then recovered to 2.10 rupees.\n\nThe slide to near 1.90 was driven by the RBI's 25-basis-point rate cut and its announcement of a $5 billion buy-sell dollar/rupee swap to boost rupee liquidity.\n\nThe rupee weakened after the rate cut, briefly slipping back below 90 per U.S. dollar following the announcement.\n\nGRAPHIC\n\nForward premiums shape the hedging costs for corporates. Higher premiums make it more expensive for importers to hedge their dollar exposures, while encouraging exporters to lock in forward rates.\n\nFor carry traders, the premium effectively represents the return on holding long-rupee positions. The higher it is, the more attractive it becomes to buy the rupee against the dollar or run rupee-based carry trades.\n\nThe RBI's rate cut surprised most interbank traders and came after the recent run-up in forward premiums fuelled by a weaker rupee. The FX swap announcement, while broadly anticipated given the need for liquidity measures and the currency's slide, added to the initial move lower in premiums.\n\nThe RBI's rate cut and swap weigh on forward premiums, yet the cut simultaneously clouds the rupee's outlook, which was already fragile due to weak foreign flows. That added pressure on the spot could put a floor under premiums, bankers said.",

    "content": "HONG KONG, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Turnout is expected to be low for Hong Kong's \"patriots only\" legislative election on Sunday, with subdued political campaigning as the population reels from the city's deadliest blaze in decades that has killed 159 people so far.\n\nVolunteers tentatively handed out flyers and hung banners outside subway stations and crowded intersections on Friday, but they were largely ignored by residents. Campaigning activities were suspended for a few days following last week's fire.\n\n\"This accident, of course, can influence the attendance of the election ... (Hong Kongers) don't have the interest, the eagerness to elect people,\" said C.K. Lau, an 82-year-old retiree.\n\nThe vote has been viewed by some analysts as a test of legitimacy for the Hong Kong government as it tries to soothe public anger over the fire and oversee an ongoing national security crackdown.\n\nLocals said they were angry and traumatised after authorities admitted that substandard building materials used during renovation work at the high-rise estate in northern Tai Po district were responsible for fuelling the blaze.\n\n\"Everyone's mood is so heavy right now,\" said May Li, 48. \"How can we still talk about holding an election under these circumstances? It definitely has to be postponed.\"\n\nThe last Legislative Council elections in 2021 recorded the lowest voter turnout - 30.2% - since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong's national security office urged residents to \"actively participate in voting,\" saying it is critical in supporting government post-disaster reconstruction efforts.\n\n\"Every voter is a stakeholder in the homeland of Hong Kong,\" a statement said. \"If you truly love Hong Kong, you will vote sincerely.\"\n\nFour people were arrested for inciting others not to vote, the city's anti-corruption body said on Thursday. A further three were arrested for the same offence on November 20, according to a previous statement from the body.\n\nNational security authorities have also repeatedly warned against attempts to \"exploit\" the fire to incite another \"colour revolution,\" referring to the 2019 pro-democracy protests that roiled the city.\n\nPublicly inciting a vote boycott was criminalised in 2021 as part of sweeping electoral reforms that effectively squeezed out pro-democracy voices from the city's 90-seat legislature.\n\nComing after Beijing imposed a national security law on the city in 2020, the reforms ensured that only pro-Beijing candidates - \"patriots\" - could run and further reduced the space for meaningful democratic participation by Hong Kong residents, analysts say.\n\nPan-democrat voters - who traditionally made up about 60% of Hong Kong's electorate - have since shunned the elections.\n\nThe number of registered voters for Sunday's polls - 4.13 million - has also dropped for the fourth consecutive year since 2021, when a peak of 4.47 million people were registered.\n\nThe current term of the Legislative Council ends on December 31. If the election were delayed, a vacuum period could emerge, making it difficult to maintain a functional lawmaking body.",

He finished with eight points to end his streak of 1,297 consecutive games with double figures in scoring. The last time James failed to reach 10 points in a game was Jan. 5, 2007 against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nAustin Reaves led L.A. with 44 points while adding 10 assists in the opener of a three-game road trip.\n\nDeandre Ayton added 17 points, Jake LaRavia scored 14 and Hachimura and Nick Smith Jr. each scored 12.\n\nScottie Barnes had 23 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists for the Raptors. Brandon Igram added 20 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Ja'Kobe Walter scored 17, Immanuel Quickley and Sandro Mamukelashvili added 13 apiece, Collin Murray-Boyles scored 12 and Jamison Battle scored 10.\n\nThe Lakers were without Luka Doncic (personal) and Marcus Smart (back).\n\nThe Raptors were without RJ Barrett (knee) and Jakob Poeltl (back).\n\nThe Lakers took a two-point lead into the fourth quarter, extending it to five with Smith's 3-pointer. Battle's 3-pointer tied the game at 108 with 7:47 to play, and his 20-footer gave Toronto a two-point lead with just under six minutes to go. Reaves tied the game at 112 with two free throws.\n\nToronto went ahead by three on Battle's layup with 4:54 left.

That dwindled to two on Walter's 3-pointer with 5:21 remaining. L.A. scored the next 10 points, taking advantage of Toronto's seven straight missed shots. The lead reached 13 on Jaxson Hayes' layup with 1:34 to go. Mamukelashvili nailed a 3-pointer with 5.3 seconds left, cutting the Lakers' lead to 67-58 at halftime.\n\nToronto tied the game at 79 on Walter's 3-pointer with 7:26 remaining in the third quarter. Murray-Boyles gave Toronto a one-point lead on a tip with 6:07 left. Reaves drained a 3-pointer, and James followed with a layup to put the Lakers ahead by four. Reaves scored 22 points in the loosely played third quarter and was the reason L.A. led 100-98 heading to the fourth.\n\n--Field Level Media",

    "title": "IKEA to ramp up US production as tariffs bite",
    "content": "LONDON/STOCKHOLM, Dec 5 (Reuters) - IKEA plans to source more products from factories in the United States, the Swedish furniture group's top supply chain executive told Reuters, as President Donald Trump's tariffs drive up the cost of importing bookcases, mattresses and sofas.\n\nThis marks a big shift for IKEA after the share of the company's U.S.-made products declined over the past decade. Inter IKEA, the brand franchiser, used to have a factory in Danville, Virginia, but shut it in 2019 and moved production back to Europe.\n\nIKEA's push to source products closer to where it sells them aims to support the retailer's expansion in the U.S., its second-biggest market, and the wider region, where it has stores in Canada, Mexico, Chile and Colombia, with plans to open in Costa Rica and Panama.\n\n\"We are designing our supply chain network to be much more resilient, robust, and responsive,\" Susanne Waidzunas, Global Supply Manager at Inter IKEA said in an interview with Reuters, adding that the company's stores in North and South America are very dependent on furniture being shipped in, with long lead times.\n\n\"The closer we can build, the faster we can react from a supply perspective, both when it goes up in demand but also when it goes down.\"\n\nThe plan to produce closer to U.S. consumers predates this year's tariff hikes and is part of a global initiative, Waidzunas said.\n\nBut the timing is now beneficial: IKEA prides itself on low prices but was forced to increase them on some products in the U.S. to offset the tariff impact. The retailer's sales have declined for two years running as it lowered prices to attract inflation-weary shoppers.\n\nSBA Home, a Lithuanian supplier to IKEA, is ramping up its first U.S. factory in Mocksville, North Carolina, a $70 million investment supported in part by Inter IKEA. The factory will make products for IKEA like top-selling KALLAX shelves.\n\nJurgita Radzevice, CEO of SBA Home, said manufacturing capacity at the largely automated factory, which is expected to produce 2 million pieces of furniture a year, is steadily increasing.\n\nIKEA depends more on imports in the U.S. than elsewhere.\n\nJust 15% of IKEA products sold in U.S. stores are made in-country, down from 19% in 2014. In Europe, 70% of the products IKEA sells are made in the region, while the equivalent figure for Asia is 80%. Its top sourcing countries are China, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, and Poland.\n\nProducing in the U.S. is more expensive, Waidzunas said, but shipping products across the world is also more costly and more unpredictable now than before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIKEA plans to buy more from existing U.S. suppliers, which include Ohio-based Sauder Woodworking, and look for new suppliers particularly of bulky items, aiming, for example, to source most of its mattresses in the U.S.",

He added that the environmental impact of shutting down older, dirtier coal power plants would be bigger.\n\nThe JETP has distributed $3.1 billion in financing so far, Airlangga said, adding international partners remained committed to the programme, noting the total funding commitment for Indonesia had been raised to $21.4 billion from an initial $20 billion.\n\nA number of projects worth a total of $5 billion are currently in the pipeline for financing, including the Saguling floating solar PV project, a transmission project in Sulawesi, and a wind power project in South Sumatra, Airlangga said.\n\nIt was not clear how soon the funds would be deployed.\n\nIndonesia, which counts coal as one of its biggest export products, has pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060.\n\nJakarta this year submitted more ambitious, self-determined emission cut targets by 2035 to the United Nations. The plan has been criticised by environmentalists as extending the life of coal assets, because it included the utilisation of Clean Coal Technology.",

    "content": "MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Two weeks after one of Nigeria's worst school kidnappings, parents of the more than 250 missing children are desperate for news and dismayed at what they see as the slow response from authorities.\n\nSunday Gbazali, a farmer and father of 12 whose 14-year-old son was among those seized on November 21 in a remote village of northern Nigeria, said he barely sleeps and his wife constantly cries thinking about their boy.\n\n\"They (the police) are just telling us to exercise patience, that they are trying to rescue the children.\"\n\n\"We are not happy with what is happening,\" he said.\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria said 303 children and 12 school staff were kidnapped by gunmen at St Mary's Catholic boarding school in Papiri, a hamlet in the state of Niger.\n\nFifty pupils managed to escape in the following hours, but since then there has been no news on the whereabouts or conditions of the other children, some as young as six, and the missing school staff.\n\nThe school was guarded by unarmed volunteer guards, who fled when attackers arrived.\n\nIt is one of the worst mass kidnappings since the 2014 abduction of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in Chibok.\n\n\"We don't know if he is sick, healthy, or even alive. How can we find peace when we do not know his current condition?\" Gbazali said of his son, his voice cracking over the phone.\n\n\"I used to hear about abductions in the news, but I never knew the pain until it happened to me.\"\n\nThe attack has put a spotlight on the persistent insecurity in Nigeria more than 10 years after the Chibok abductions, at a time when the country is under scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump over its alleged ill-treatment of Christians.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu denies the accusations of religious persecution but is under pressure. He declared a nationwide security emergency last week and ordered the recruitment of thousands of additional army and police personnel to tackle the surge in violence across the country.\n\nHis national security adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, told local Catholic leaders in Kontagora town on Monday that \"the children are doing fine and will be back soon,\" according to a statement by CAN in Niger state.\n\nBut there has been no further update, leaving families in an anxious limbo. The identities of the kidnappers, believed to be hiding in the dense and vast forests dotting Nigeria's largest state, are unknown and no ransom has been demanded, parents told Reuters.\n\n\"The government says that it's taking action, but up to now, we haven't got any information,\" said Emmanuel Bala, who chairs the school's parent-teacher association and whose 13-year-old daughter is among those missing.\n\n\"The past two weeks have not been easy at all. It is not something that people can imagine. We are feeling deeply sad.\"\n\nAnother parent who works for Niger state civil service said that after the meeting with Ribadu he hoped a rescue was imminent. \"Unfortunately, days have passed, and we are left with little hope,\" said the man, who declined to be named fearing reprisals from his employer.\n\nParents said they were called to the school last Friday, a full week after the kidnapping, to register their missing children with the police. They came from many different locations, and outside states.\n\nThe registration was ordered after the state governor of Niger, Mohammed Umar Bago, said the numbers of those kidnapped had been exaggerated.\n\n\"The government and the public need evidence of the fact that children were actually abducted,\" Reverend Father Stephen Ndubuisi-Okafor, who is from the Catholic Diocese in charge of the school, said as the registration took place.\n\nThey had not made up any numbers or names, he said, \"this is actually what is happening.\"\n\nAsked why it had taken a week to list the names of the missing children, Niger state police spokesperson Wasiu Abiodun said police did \"not want to rush to conclusions while the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nHe told Reuters police documentation showed 215 students were still captive, but did not say if all parents had registered their missing children.\n\nBishop Bulus Yohanna, CAN chairman for Niger state and head of the school, said registration of the missing children was incomplete because some parents had not received the message to come as they were spread over such a remote area, with virtually no network.\n\nThe frustration of the families was shared by activists of the \"#BringBackOurGirls\" global movement sparked by the Boko Haram kidnappings.\n\nWhile many of the Chibok hostages were liberated in following years, around 90 of the girls are still unaccounted for, and the jihadist group's tactic has since been adopted by criminal gangs without ideological affiliation seeking ransom payments, with authorities seemingly powerless to stop them.\n\n\"These atrocities are not isolated tragedies – they are part of a systemic failure spanning over 11 years,\" the movement said in an open letter to Tinubu. It said that since the Chibok abductions, at least another 1,800 students had been kidnapped in \"a relentless cycle of terror\" in Nigeria.\n\nAmnesty International said in a statement that the government's failure to stop the kidnappings was putting the education of millions of Nigerian children at risk. It said nearly 20,500 schools had been closed in seven northern states in the wake of the St Mary's school attack.\n\nAccording to United Nations figures, Nigeria has one of the highest numbers of unschooled children in the world at 20 million, most of them in the north, partly because parents fear kidnappings.\n\nThirteen-year-old Stephen Samuel, one of the children who managed to escape, told Reuters that even if all the hostages were released he was not sure life could ever go back to normal.\n\n\"When these people come back, will we be able to go to school again? Which school will we go to?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am thinking maybe school has ended.\"",

    "content": "TAIPEI/TOKYO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan and Japan voiced concern on Friday over Chinese military activities in the region, after Reuters reported that Beijing had deployed a large number of vessels across East Asian waters this week in its largest maritime show of force to date.\n\nReuters exclusively reported on Thursday that China was deploying a large number of naval and coast guard ships across East Asian waters – at one point more than 100 – citing sources and intelligence reports reviewed by Reuters.\n\nTalking to reporters in Taipei, Taiwan presidential spokesperson Karen Kuo said the Chinese activity was not confined to the Taiwan Strait but stretched from the Yellow Sea down through waters near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, into the South China Sea and the western Pacific.\n\n\"This indeed poses a threat and impact to the Indo-Pacific and the whole region,\" she said. \"We also especially call on China to live up to its responsibilities as a major power and to exercise restraint in its actions.\"\n\nKuo said Taiwan President Lai Ching-te had instructed the security forces to maintain full situational awareness and provide timely updates. Taiwan would keep close contact and cooperation with unspecified \"friendly partners\" to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, she said.\n\nIn Tokyo, Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, asked about Chinese activity in the East China Sea, said Japan was aware of the reports and was watching Chinese military movements \"with great attention\", while declining to comment on the specific deployment.\n\n\"China has been expanding and stepping up its military activities in the areas surrounding Japan, and we make a constant effort to gather and analyse information on Chinese military movements with great attention,\" he told reporters without giving a time frame of the Chinese activities.\n\n\"In any event, the government will continue to monitor developments around Japan with deep concern and will make every effort to ensure thorough information gathering and surveillance,\" he said.\n\nNovember and December are traditionally a busy season for Chinese military exercises, though the People's Liberation Army has not made any announcements of large-scale officially named drills.\n\nThe operations exceed China's mass naval deployment in December last year that prompted Taiwan to raise its alert level, the sources said.\n\nThe rise in activity is happening as China and Japan are in a diplomatic crisis after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said last month that a hypothetical Chinese attack on democratically ruled Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.\n\nBeijing has also been angered by an announcement last month by Taiwan President Lai Ching-te of an extra $40 billion in defence spending to counter China, which views the island as its own territory over Taiwan's strong rejection.",

    "content": "MUMBAI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its key repo rate by 25 basis points on Friday and left the door open for further easing as it took steps to boost banking-sector liquidity by up to $16 billion to support a \"goldilocks\" economy.\n\nThe world's fifth-largest economy is under pressure from punitive tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, widening its trade deficit and pushing its currency to a record low.\n\nGlobal headwinds have prompted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration to step up domestic economic reforms, including paring consumer taxes, changing labour rules and easing financial sector regulations.\n\nThe RBI's six-member monetary policy committee voted unanimously to lower the repo rate (INREPO=ECI), opens new tab to 5.25%, in line with a consensus view, and maintained a \"neutral\" stance, suggesting room for further rate cuts.\n\nThe central bank has now cut rates by a total of 125 basis points since February 2025, the most aggressive easing since 2019. It held rates in August and October.\n\nThe Indian economy is facing a \"rare goldilocks\" period, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said in a video address.\n\nSince October, India's economy has experienced rapid disinflation leading to a breach of the central bank's lower threshold of tolerance, said Malhotra, adding that growth has remained strong.\n\nGiven these macroeconomic conditions, \"policy space\" exists to support growth, he added.\n\nGarima Kapoor, economist at Mumbai-based Elara Securities, expects another rate cut, noting \"there are no signs of overheating in the economy.\"\n\n\"We believe that there would be scope for another 25 basis points cut this cycle as inflation is expected to remain benign,\" he said.\n\nThe RBI also decided to conduct open market operations of 1 trillion rupees ($11.14 billion) to buy bonds this month, and another $5 billion in forex swaps to add liquidity to the banking system and speed up transmission of lower rates.\n\nIndia's benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped nearly 5 basis points after the central bank's moves but rebounded thereafter to trade flat at 6.4841%. The rupee fell marginally, while the benchmark equity indexes were up 0.4% each.\n\nThe central bank raised its GDP forecast for the current year to 7.3% from its previous estimate of 6.8% while the inflation projection was lowered to 2% versus 2.6% in October.\n\nThe South Asian economy expanded at a sharper-than-expected clip of 8.2% in the July-September quarter but growth is expected to slow as the full impact of up to 50% tariffs imposed by the U.S. hit exports and sectors from textiles to chemicals.\n\nExternal uncertainties could pose \"downside risks\" to growth, Malhotra said.\n\nOn the other hand, retail inflation stood at an all-time low of 0.25% in October and is expected to remain soft in coming months. The central bank targets inflation at 4%, within a tolerance band of 2% on either side.\n\n\"Underlying inflation pressures are even lower\", Malhotra said, pointing to a \"generalised\" decline in price pressures.\n\n\"With RBI continuing to leave room open for further easing, we do not rule out another 25-basis-point cut, with the likely terminal rate at 5% followed by a prolonged pause,\" said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank in Mumbai.\n\nMalhotra said India's external sector remains \"resilient\" and external financing requirements will be met \"comfortably\".\n\nConcern about stalling dollar flows at a time when India's trade deficit is widening has pushed the South Asian nation's currency to an all-time low.\n\nThe central bank will tolerate a weaker currency, and only intervene to curb speculative activity, Reuters reported on Thursday.\n\nIndia’s foreign exchange reserves of $686.2 billion provide a robust import cover of more than 11 months, Malhotra said, without commenting specifically on the rupee.\n\n($1 = 89.8020 Indian rupees)",

    "content": "LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Copper is on a bull surge with the price hitting record highs on both the London and Shanghai markets this week.\n\nEveryone's talking about a copper supply crunch. Physical premiums are soaring. Smelters are being squeezed by a shortfall of mined concentrate.\n\nJust to cap it all, London Metal Exchange (LME) stocks have just been raided, reducing available inventory to below 100,000 metric tons for the first time since July.\n\nYet it's not as if the global manufacturing sector is similarly fired up. September saw activity contract in China, Japan, Europe and, for the ninth consecutive month, the United States.\n\nTariff uncertainty hangs heavy on the world's largest manufacturing nations and it is also key to understanding copper's current euphoria.\n\nCopper's bull run is as much about market fracture as it is about a straightforward supply crunch.\n\nFEAST...\n\nThis week's raid on LME copper stocks saw 54,350 tons, around a third of registered inventory, cancelled in preparation for physical load-out.\n\nIt's highly likely this metal is destined either for the United States or to fill a supply-chain gap caused by other units heading that way.\n\nThe United States is now the market of first resort for copper thanks to the lingering threat of import tariffs.\n\nA decision on whether to extend tariffs on copper products to refined metal has been deferred until the middle of next year.\n\nBut the CME U.S. copper contract is still commanding a hefty premium over the international price traded on the LME, keeping the physical arbitrage window wide open.\n\nU.S. imports of refined copper more than doubled year-on-year to 1.19 million tons in January-August and more will arrive as long as the CME premium covers the shipping costs. Which at around $500 per ton on a three-month forward basis it more than comfortably does.\n\nCME stocks, all customs-cleared, have mushroomed from 85,000 tons at the start of the year to 394,000 tons and now account for 55% of global exchange inventory.\n\nThere is no copper supply crunch in the United States and there's not going to be one any time soon.\n\nBut there is growing tightness everywhere else in the world as metal continues to gravitate towards the United States.\n\nThat's why producers have been able to demand record premiums for deliveries next year.\n\nChilean producer Codelco has hiked its European premium by 39% to $345 per ton over the LME price and is pushing for $350 per ton for Chinese buyers, who find themselves in the unfamiliar position of being second in line in the copper delivery queue.\n\nIndeed, China itself has been caught up in the physical copper scramble.\n\nThe mass relocation of copper inventory to the United States has extended to China's bonded warehouse zones with 128,000 tons re-exported to the United States since February, according to Chinese customs.\n\nChinese producers have also been lifting deliveries to LME warehouses as a tightening London market opens up an export arbitrage window.\n\nChinese-brand copper accounted for 82% of LME registered stocks at the end of October, up from 51% at the start of January.\n\nYet even as global inventory is reshuffled, total exchange stocks are rising, closing November above the 700,000-ton mark for the first time since early 2020.\n\nThere is no global shortage of copper but there is a widening split between the U.S. market and the rest of the world. It's captured by the CME and LME forward curves - in comfortable contango and widening backwardation respectively.\n\nThe splintering of the copper market is not just geographical but also internal.\n\nChina has brought too much smelting capacity online in too short a time for the world's mines to supply, a mismatch compounded by this year's litany of disruption at some of the world's largest mines such as Grasberg in Indonesia.\n\nThe result is a crisis of smelter profitability. Spot processing fees have been trading at negative levels for months, meaning smelters are giving away for free what should be a core revenue stream.\n\nSeveral Western smelters have closed and the Chinese smelter sector is now confronted with the hangover from its previous exuberance in the form of potentially negative fees for next year's annual contracts.\n\nThe China Smelters Purchase Team, comprising the country's top-ten producers, has pledged to reduce production by 10% to help stabilise the raw materials market.\n\nIt will also monitor members' spot market activity to prevent what it called \"malignant competition\" between smelters for concentrate.\n\nCollective cutback announcements are standard operating procedure for China's metal smelters whenever the going gets tough but the impact has as often as not been less than promised.\n\nThe announcement, though, is evidence of a dysfunctional raw materials market. The current annual benchmark pricing model is at risk of splintering into multiple short-term and binary deals under the pressure.\n\nThis injects another level of uncertainty into an already complex copper pricing picture.\n\nSo is the world facing an imminent copper supply crunch?\n\nWell, it depends very much on which Doctor Copper you ask. But none of them is saying much about the state of global manufacturing right now.\n\nAndy Home is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own\n\nEnjoying this column?

    "content": "Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its key repo rate by 25 basis points on Friday and took steps to boost banking-sector liquidity by up to $16 billion to support a \"goldilocks economy\".\n\nThe six-member monetary policy committee voted unanimously to lower the repo rate (INREPO=ECI), opens new tab to 5.25%, in line with a consensus view, and maintained a \"neutral\" stance, suggesting room for further rate cuts.\n\nCOMMENTARY:\n\n\"This move is the catalyst needed to revive purchasing power and activate the crucial segment of first-time affordable and mid-market home-buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines, transforming fence-sitters into active buyers.\"\n\n\"Alongside the rate cut, the RBI announced open market purchases of government bonds and swap transactions, signalling a clear easing bias.\"\n\n\"The key driver behind the policy shift, despite strong macro fundamentals, is the sustained downside surprise in inflation prints.\"\n\n\"If inflation continues to trend below the projected path, the possibility of another 25 bps cut cannot be dismissed.\"\n\n\"We believe this could be the last rate cut of this cycle. From here on, RBI will mostly support via liquidity.\"\n\n\"Rupee remains steady, (and) is unlikely to face pressure because of (Friday's) rate cut, especially as expectations of a December Fed rate cut have also increased.\"\n\n\"As we expected, the RBI delivered a rate cut recognising the impending risks to growth and utilising the monetary space yielded by low inflation.\"\n\n\"The central bank aptly took a forward-looking view on growth and inflation as the latter is expected to remain below 4% up till the second quarter of FY27.\"\n\n\"We keep our forecasts unchanged, projecting GDP growth at 7.3% for FY26 and inflation at 2%. For FY27, we expect GDP growth at 6.5% and inflation at 4%.\"\n\n\"Surprisingly lower inflation prompted the RBI to announce a 25-bps rate cut, as widely expected, given its outlook for markedly slower growth during the second half of FY26.\"\n\n\"Adding to this are concerns over the external sector, lack of visibility around the Indo-US trade deal, and multiple high-frequency indicators already signaling a slowdown in activity despite the prevailing narrative of a demand surge following the GST rate cut.\"\n\n\"These factors suggest the possibility of an additional rate cut going forward.\"\n\n\"With inflation persistently undershooting, the RBI found it harder to ignore its core mandate of inflation management and decided to cut by 25bps.\"\n\n\"The RBI delivered on most fronts on Friday, lowering rates along our expectations and taking pro-liquidity steps, as well as moves to prevent re-hardening in borrowing costs.\"\n\n\"The policy decision was likely dictated by a higher weightage to below-target inflation, which had provided a sizeable real rate buffer.\"\n\n\"We believe that there would be scope for another 25 bps cut this cycle as inflation is expected to remain benign, and despite high real GDP print, there are no signs of over-heating in the economy.\"\n\n\"The 25bps rate cut, along with liquidity measures, will help keep bond yields in check and help sustain the momentum in the economy.\"\n\n\"The repo rate cut, along with liquidity easing measures, announced by the RBI is exactly in line with our expectations.\"\n\n\"With RBI continuing to leave room open for further easing, we do not rule out another 25bps cut, with the likely terminal rate at 5% followed by a prolonged pause.\"",

But at least the Fed will get key data pertaining to the other side of its employment-nurturing, inflation-taming mandate today with the delayed release of the PCE deflator, among the Fed's favoured price statistics, although the data is for September.\n\nBets on a quarter-point reduction by the rate-setting FOMC on Wednesday have climbed to 87%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, firming over the past week after the private ADP jobs report showed a surprise decline in payrolls for November.\n\nAlthough weekly jobless claims fell to a three-year low in data on Thursday, economists say the numbers were likely skewed by the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nAs a result, the dollar index is languishing near a five-week low, and stock markets globally are getting a tailwind.\n\nBeyond the near-sure-thing of a Fed cut this month, markets are hungry for clues about possible reductions next year, and that will be a key focus for Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference.\n\nBut it's not the only lead on the longer-term rates outlook, after President Donald Trump earlier this week presented White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett as a potential Fed Chair when Powell's term ends in May.\n\nAn FT report said bond investors expressed concerns to the Treasury over the possibility of Hassett as head of the central bank, predicting he would aggressively cut rates to align with Trump's preference for significantly easier policy settings.\n\nFed officials are in a blackout period ahead of the meeting, but markets - as always - need to be on alert for social media posts by Trump.\n\nIn Europe today, ECB chief economist Philip Lane chairs a session at a conference on fiscal policy.\n\nThe most significant data point in the region is UK home prices for November.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Friday:\n\n-UK Halifax house prices for November\n\n-ECB's Lane chairs session at ECB-IMF conference in Frankfurt\n\n-U.S. PCE deflator for September",

More than any other league in any sport around the world. And global superstars, as we all know, are making MLS their league of choice.\"\n\nGarber highlighted Saturday's MLS Cup final in Florida, where Messi's Miami will host the Vancouver Whitecaps, a side that includes Thomas Mueller, a 2014 World Cup winner with Germany.\n\n\"The greatest player to ever play the game, Lionel Messi, will go up against another World Cup champion and one of the world's most decorated players in Thomas Mueller ... in what we hope will be an epic MLS Cup,\" Garber said.\n\nNext year's World Cup will feature 48 teams in 12 groups of four, with the draw at Washington's John F.

We are in the midst of a dramatic, generational change – soccer is now an American pastime.\"",

But the dispute has revived doubts about Merz's ability to manage his party, potentially leaving him dependent on the opposition to get the package through parliament.\n\nHis broad coalition of conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) has a slender majority of 12 votes in parliament - enough theoretically to pass the legislation, which maintains current pension levels.\n\nBut the conservatives' youth faction, which has 18 votes, says the measure perpetuates a financially unsustainable system, leaving younger generations to foot the bill. Those legislators have left it unclear which way they will vote.\n\nThe Left Party said on Wednesday it would abstain from the vote to ensure the legislation passed in order to protect pensioners from what it called \"power games\". Their abstention means the measure needs fewer votes to pass.\n\nPolitical analysts say infighting over the package has heightened doubt about the coalition's ability to push through key legislation following a series of blunders this year.\n\nBut if Merz has to also rely on the opposition to pass the bill, it would feed doubts about the mammoth tasks of reforming Germany's ailing economy, Europe's largest, and rebuilding its long-neglected military.\n\n\"Even if the coalition wins the vote, they will hardly gain stability, because the path to forming this majority was very shaky,\" said political scientist Johannes Hillje.\n\n\"If they don't have their own majority, then we would have a coalition crisis - as a government is defined by whether it can produce its own majorities.\"\n\nSuch an outcome could further boost support for the far-right Alternative for Germany, which has surged to first place in nationwide polls in recent months and is on track to make strong gains in five state elections next year.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Merz, who had never previously held government office, railed against the infighting within the coalition of his SPD predecessor Olaf Scholz.\n\nExpectations were high after he secured a historic agreement for record spending on infrastructure and defence before even taking office, and made clear he intended to return Germany to the international stage as a major player.\n\nBut his own coalition has proven shaky since he took office on day one, when he became the first chancellor ever to require a second round of votes to secure formal approval of parliament.\n\nIn the summer, Merz also failed to marshal his conservatives behind the SPD's agreed candidate for the constitutional court, dooming the vote.\n\n\"The government's public image as ineffective, divided and poorly managed is becoming increasingly entrenched,\" said Jan Techau at consulting firm Eurasia Group.\n\nHillje said these slip-ups demonstrated a \"failure of political craftsmanship\" by both Merz and the conservatives' parliamentary leader Jens Spahn, who could have negotiated better with dissenters within their own parliamentary group.\n\nMerz has won plaudits abroad for his strong engagement for Ukraine, but at home his popularity has sunk to around 25%, making him one of the least popular chancellors in memory.\n\nMeanwhile combined support for the conservatives and SPD is down to 39% from 44.9% in February's election, according to the latest poll by Forsa. The AfD, which surged into pole position in August, remains in the lead on 26%.",

    "title": "Video shows final, confused moments of survivors of U.S. boat strike in Caribbean, say sources",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - When the U.S. military carried out its first strike against a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean on September 2, the attack began with an airburst munition exploding above the 11-member crew like an umbrella of shrapnel.\n\nA video of the attack, shown to U.S. lawmakers on Thursday and described to Reuters by two sources familiar with the imagery, showed smoke clearing and two men, who had somehow lived through the blast, clinging to a severed section of the front of the vessel in a futile effort to survive.\n\nThey were shirtless, unarmed and carried no visible communications equipment. They also appeared to have no idea what had just hit them, or that the U.S. military was weighing whether to finish them off.\n\n\"The video follows them for about an hour as they tried to flip the boat back over. They couldn't do it,\" one source said.\n\nAdmiral Frank Bradley, who was the head of the Joint Special Operations Command at the time, concluded that the wreckage was likely being kept afloat because there was cocaine inside and could drift long enough to be recovered, said the sources.\n\nSo Bradley decided that, in order to complete the mission assigned by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and neutralize the threat posed by the drug boat, he would need to attack the vessel again.\n\nThe video showed three additional munitions being fired at the damaged vessel, said the sources.\n\n\"You could see their faces, bodies... Then boom, boom, boom,\" the first source said.\n\nThe video was shown behind closed doors on Capitol Hill by Bradley and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The reactions of the lawmakers who viewed it split along party lines, with Democrats voicing distress but Republicans defending the strike as legal.\n\nIt was the first of 22 attacks on drug vessels carried out by the U.S. military as part of the Trump administration's campaign to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. The strikes have killed 87 people, with one carried out in the eastern Pacific on Thursday.\n\n\"I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat, loaded with drugs bound for the United States, back over so they could stay in the fight,\" said Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nHe said Bradley and Hegseth did exactly what was expected of them.\n\nBut Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters after the briefing it was \"one of the most troubling things\" he had seen.\n\nSenator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the video and said it should be released to the public.\n\nThe Defense Department's Law of War Manual forbids attacks on combatants who are incapacitated, unconscious or shipwrecked, as long as they abstain from hostilities and do not attempt to escape. The manual cites firing upon shipwreck survivors as an example of a \"clearly illegal\" order that should be refused.\n\nHowever, the United States has framed the attacks as a war with drug cartels, calling them armed groups, and says the drugs being carried to the United States kill Americans.",
