    "content": "BEIJING, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Chinese leader Xi Jinping accompanied French President Emmanuel Macron to Chengdu on Friday, a rare gesture seemingly reserved for the head of Europe's second-largest economy that highlights Beijing's focus on Paris in its ties with the European Union.\n\nEven when U.S. President Donald Trump made a landmark visit to China early during his first term in 2017, and Xi lavished him with a private dinner within Beijing's Forbidden City, the trip was confined to the Chinese capital.\n\nBut despite the apparent bonhomie between Xi and Macron, the French president's visit so far has resulted in little beyond bolstering Beijing's diplomatic credentials, as world leaders turn to China seeking economic assurances due to Trump's tariffs, analysts say. It has also provided Macron with a chance to project statesmanship after a tough summer in domestic politics.\n\nInvestors are watching to see whether a day that began with the French president surprising fellow joggers in the city's Jincheng Lake Park, before joining Xi at a historic dam site, will end with major commercial deals or a thaw in EU-China trade tensions, given that Macron has been joined on his fourth state visit to China by the heads of some of France's biggest firms.\n\nA meeting in the Chinese capital on Thursday only resulted in 12 cooperation agreements covering areas such as population ageing, nuclear energy and panda conservation, and no monetary total was disclosed.\n\n\"I think they (France) thought that Xi would be in a position to offer a lot because Europe is really preparing this economic security doctrine,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, senior fellow at the think tank Bruegel.\n\n\"Macron probably felt that given his weight and the fact that France is clearly the one that is pushing the most on economic security, that they would get a deal, but nope.\"\n\nStill, the French president will take the publicity win from receiving a rock-star welcome from students at Sichuan University, who crowded around him before a speech in which he urged China to reflect on its role in global affairs.\n\n\"We are at a moment of unprecedented rupture,\" Macron said. \"The world we built after World War II, which was based on what we call multilateralism and therefore cooperation between powers is cracking, fracturing.\"\n\nMacron also took aim at China's notion that the West's power is waning.\n\n\"Plenty of people will try to tell you that Europe is old,\" he said. \"That the rich countries you find in the G7 are arrogant. That the West is looking down on the Global South. But all of that is a narrative, a fabrication.\"\n\nBeijing may see friendly ties with France as a way into expanding its influence within the 27-strong EU, but is very constrained in its ability to offer Paris major concessions.\n\nThe Chinese leader was not expected to sign off on a long-anticipated 500-jet Airbus order, for example, as that would reduce China's leverage in trade talks with the U.S., which is pressing for new Boeing commitments.\n\nXi is also unlikely to ease conditions for French cognac makers or pork producers, as doing so would weaken Beijing's negotiating position with Brussels over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nNor can Xi offer Macron a breakthrough on the war in Ukraine for him to take back to Europe, with China having recently reaffirmed its support for Russia.\n\nRecent visits by Spain's King Felipe VI and German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil were similarly low on tangible outcomes.\n\nChinese government advisers say Beijing feels it has the upper hand and is waiting for Brussels to yield and accept a minimum price plan for its EVs rather than the tariffs currently levied on them.\n\n\"They (the EU) now recognise the complexity of the issue. After Trump became president again, they realised they are too dependent on the U.S.... Europe is now in need of more reciprocal trade with China,\" one advisor said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak with media.\n\n\"The EU should really reflect on its China policy and not tie it too closely to Russia and Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nXi also did not raise the prospect of a trade deal with the EU with Macron - which China's top diplomat Wang Yi brought up when Estonia's foreign minister visited last month and the Chinese commerce ministry has touted - despite talks over a landmark EU-China investment pact having been frozen since 2021.\n\nThe vote on whether to adopt the European Commission's EV tariffs divided the member states, with France voting in favour of the duties while Germany, Europe's biggest economy, voted against.\n\nChina could seek to exploit such divisions.\n\n\"It is interesting that they (China) keep raising it (a trade deal) with the member states,\" said a European Commission official. \"We have no plans whatsoever to have any kind of trade agreement with China,\" they added, also requesting anonymity.",

The Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 133-125 on Monday night.\n\nSeven players scored in the fourth quarter Thursday for the Jazz, who shot 63.6% from the field (14-for-22) over the final 12 minutes, including 75% (6-for-8) from 3-point range.\n\nThe 42-point outburst was the biggest fourth quarter of the season for Utah and two points shy of matching its most prolific period, accomplished in the third quarter against the Indiana Pacers on Nov. 11 and then achieved again in the first quarter against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Nov. 21.\n\n\"In the fourth quarter, we started making shots and having energy,\" said Keyonte George, who scored eight of his 29 points in the final period. \"To be a good team, you have to be able to win on the road.\"\n\nWinning at home hasn't been a problem for the Knicks, who own an Eastern Conference-best 11-1 home mark. None of the victories at Madison Square Garden were by fewer than eight points.\n\nStill, the Knicks saw room for improvement on Wednesday, when Jalen Brunson's buzzer-beating 3-pointer in the second quarter sparked a 47-28 run that extended their lead to 97-75 with 9:29 left in the game.\n\nCharlotte responded with a 21-7 run, and while the Knicks maintained a double-digit lead for the final four-plus minutes, they weren't able to pull Brunson and his fellow starters -- Mikal Bridges, Josh Hart, Miles McBride and Karl-Anthony Towns -- until the last 60 seconds.\n\nThe abbreviated rally by the Hornets reminded the Knicks of their 123-117 loss to the host Boston Celtics on Tuesday night, when New York squandered a 14-point lead by being outscored 73-44 in the middle two quarters.\n\n\"We've got to do a better job of slowing down their runs and limiting them,\" Brunson said Wednesday night, \"but we can't let them get all the way back like we've been doing. But I think first and foremost, how we respond to that is how we get better as a team. As long as we're making strides in that direction, we're improving.\"\n\n--Field Level Media",

    "content": "PARIS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Saab (SAABb.ST), opens new tab and Airbus (AIR.PA), opens new tab are discussing co-operation on unmanned warplane technology, senior executives of the companies told Reuters, a move highlighting surging interest in drones and evolving alliances in Europe's fractured defence industry.\n\nThe project, revealed in separate CEO interviews at a European industry event this week, focuses on exploring unmanned aircraft to support the current generation of crewed combat jets like the Airbus-backed Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab Gripen E.\n\nBut industry sources said that if successful, it could also provide a catalyst for broader co-operation on air power, especially if a troubled FCAS fighter project between France and Airbus' defence paymasters Germany and Spain falls apart.\n\nAsked whether Airbus had already been in touch with Saab about joining forces if FCAS fails, Saab CEO Micael Johansson said the companies already had good relations through Saab's Arexis Electronic Warfare system, equipping German Eurofighters.\n\nHe added: \"And we have discussed whether we can we do something on the unmanned side which complements our legacy fighters\".\n\nSaab is also talking to other players but no decisions have been taken. \"That could be an opportunity, but of course we are discussing,\" Johansson said on the sidelines of a Brussels forum hosted by Europe's ASD, the association which represents Europe's aerospace and defence industry.\n\nAsked at the same event about those remarks, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury confirmed the previously unreported talks and said the companies had strong relations in electronics and missiles.\n\n\"And we see good perspectives to continue to work with them on unmanned - that's something that we are discussing with them, which is unrelated to FCAS,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll see what the programme will look like in the future. But today, the discussions we're having are directly between Airbus and Saab, unrelated to other problems.\"\n\nBoth companies have joined in a surge of interest in futuristic uncrewed fighters known as collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) or loyal wingman, designed to support human-piloted warplanes.\n\nAirbus presented a model of its stealthy \"Wingman\" concept at the Berlin Airshow in 2024.\n\nSaab said last month it had received a new Swedish government order for studies on manned and unmanned warplanes, extending a previous contract dating from Sweden's 2023 decision to quit the UK-led Tempest fighter study, now part of the GCAP fighter jet project between Britain, Italy and Japan.\n\nMinisters from Germany, France and Spain are due to discuss splits in the FCAS programme next week. Industry sources have said Airbus has been in regular contact at CEO level with both Saab and GCAP member BAE Systems (BAES.L), opens new tab to discuss options.\n\nThe 100-billion-euro Future Combat Air System (FCAS), floated more than eight years ago, has been stuck in disputes between the companies involved over workshare and technology.\n\nJohansson declined to discuss any implications for Saab of the in-fighting within FCAS but said that in general terms, \"we don't speak about Sweden replacing someone or something\".\n\nAnalysts say decisions over the next generation of fighters will shape the defence industry and its alliances for decades.\n\nSweden remained independent during the last round of fighter developments, creating the Gripen as France built the Rafale and Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy co-developed the Eurofighter.\n\nFor the next generation of warplanes, the cards have been reshuffled, with France joining Germany and Spain in FCAS, also known by its French acronym SCAF, and Britain merging its efforts with Japan inside GCAP, which is open to new members.\n\nSweden has yet to show its hand, having initially partnered with Britain and now conducting its own research on a successor to the Gripen with political decisions due in 2030. Johansson said he thought decisions could come even earlier, \"maybe 2028\".\n\nJohansson said Saab would not relinquish its seat in the small club of global arms firms capable of developing fighters.\n\n\"I'm not excluding any sort of partnerships going forward. That could absolutely be a way forward, but with retaining OEM (manufacturer) capability on the fighter side: why would we let go of that?\"",

President Petr Pavel said he would appoint Babis after he cleared conflict-of-interest concerns by agreeing to shift his Agrofert business group to an independently governed trust.\n\nBabis' net worth is $4.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and he is among the 10 richest Czechs.\n\nBabis took over part of a communist-era trading firm in the 1990s and built it into Agrofert, his main asset.\n\nHe also separately holds investments worth at least hundreds of millions of euros in various companies through a fund called Hartenberg and the Imoba company. He has not said he would make any changes to his control of those holdings.\n\nAs prime minister and a member of the EU's top council of heads of government, Babis will be deciding on national and pan-European regulations, taxes and subsidies.\n\nBabis' firms have received public contracts, and investment incentives worth tens of millions of euros - such as tax relief - from the Czech, Slovak and Hungarian governments.\n\nThey get European Union payments for farmed land and animals bred, according to the firm's 2024 annual report.\n\nThey have also received subsidies for innovative investment projects from EU funds. Some those dating to Babis' previous term in office in 2017-2021 have been stopped or are subject to legal and administrative battles.\n\nWhen Babis was prime minister previously, he transferred his assets to trust funds, which courts and the European Commission later ruled to be insufficient. The new set-up is stricter, he said, going beyond legal requirements.\n\nAgrofert is a conglomerate of around 230 companies around central Europe in farming, food processing, fertilizers, plastics, fuels, forestry and other businesses.\n\nIt has around 29,000 employees and its largest firms are in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany and Austria.\n\nIts 2024 revenue was 212 billion crowns ($10.2 billion), and net attributable profit of 7 billion crowns, up from 2.1 billion in 2023, helped by one-off income from the sale of the group's media house and a chemicals business.\n\nIt received 1.7 billion crowns in subsidies in 2024, most tied to farm production under the EU's farm policy.\n\nIt is a significant European maker of urea-based diesel engine additive AdBlue, as well as ammonia, fertilisers, plastics, solvents, tar products and biofuels.\n\nAmong its major firms in this segment are SKW Stickstoffwerke Piesteritz, GreenChem, Duslo, Deza, Precheza and Lovochemie.\n\nRecent acquisitions include the 810 million euro takeover of Austrian energy group Borealis' nitrogen business in 2023 and the purchase last month of Rotterdam ammonia port terminal OCI Ammonia Holding for 290 million euros.\n\nIt owns major poultry and meat processing companies, bakeries, milk processing firms across central Europe. Agrofert food products are ubiquitous in Czech supermarkets.\n\nIt operates farms on more than 140,000 hectares, is a major poultry, pig and cattle breeder and has forestry and timber interests.\n\nBabis is the majority owner of Hartenberg Capital, which is led and minority-owned by investment professional Jozef Janov.

    "content": "BERLIN, Dec 5 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's ability to control his unruly coalition faces a test on Friday when parliament votes on a pensions bill that stirred a revolt by younger members of his own conservative party.\n\nFears the revolt could lead to the bill's defeat, endangering the survival of the coalition, appear to have eased after the opposition Left party said it would abstain. But the dispute has revived doubts about Merz's ability to manage his party, potentially leaving him dependent on the opposition to get the package through parliament.\n\nHis broad coalition of conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) has a slender majority of 12 votes in parliament - enough theoretically to pass the legislation, which maintains current pension levels.\n\nBut the conservatives' youth faction, which has 18 votes, says the measure perpetuates a financially unsustainable system, leaving younger generations to foot the bill. Those legislators have left it unclear which way they will vote.\n\nThe Left Party said on Wednesday it would abstain from the vote to ensure the legislation passed in order to protect pensioners from what it called \"power games\". Their abstention means the measure needs fewer votes to pass.\n\nPolitical analysts say infighting over the package has heightened doubt about the coalition's ability to push through key legislation following a series of blunders this year.\n\nBut if Merz has to also rely on the opposition to pass the bill, it would feed doubts about the mammoth tasks of reforming Germany's ailing economy, Europe's largest, and rebuilding its long-neglected military.\n\n\"Even if the coalition wins the vote, they will hardly gain stability, because the path to forming this majority was very shaky,\" said political scientist Johannes Hillje.\n\n\"If they don't have their own majority, then we would have a coalition crisis - as a government is defined by whether it can produce its own majorities.\"\n\nSuch an outcome could further boost support for the far-right Alternative for Germany, which has surged to first place in nationwide polls in recent months and is on track to make strong gains in five state elections next year.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Merz, who had never previously held government office, railed against the infighting within the coalition of his SPD predecessor Olaf Scholz.\n\nExpectations were high after he secured a historic agreement for record spending on infrastructure and defence before even taking office, and made clear he intended to return Germany to the international stage as a major player.\n\nBut his own coalition has proven shaky since he took office on day one, when he became the first chancellor ever to require a second round of votes to secure formal approval of parliament.\n\nIn the summer, Merz also failed to marshal his conservatives behind the SPD's agreed candidate for the constitutional court, dooming the vote.\n\n\"The government's public image as ineffective, divided and poorly managed is becoming increasingly entrenched,\" said Jan Techau at consulting firm Eurasia Group.\n\nHillje said these slip-ups demonstrated a \"failure of political craftsmanship\" by both Merz and the conservatives' parliamentary leader Jens Spahn, who could have negotiated better with dissenters within their own parliamentary group.\n\nMerz has won plaudits abroad for his strong engagement for Ukraine, but at home his popularity has sunk to around 25%, making him one of the least popular chancellors in memory.\n\nMeanwhile combined support for the conservatives and SPD is down to 39% from 44.9% in February's election, according to the latest poll by Forsa. The AfD, which surged into pole position in August, remains in the lead on 26%.",

    "content": "LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The long-awaited December U.S. Federal Reserve meeting is almost here.\n\nBut it's not the only game in town for financial markets with Canadian, Swiss, Australian and Turkish central banks also meeting and the latest China data to pore over.\n\nHere's your one-stop shop for the week ahead in world markets from Alden Bentley in New York, Rae Wee in Singapore and Dhara Ranasinghe, Amanda Cooper and Karin Strohecker in London.\n\nSpeculation about whether the Fed will ease rates for a third time next week has come full circle since an October rate cut.\n\nAfter a rough patch, Wall Street is again buoyed as if another reduction is a done deal.\n\nPolicymakers were not unanimous about the last one and differences remain. Several lean dovish, and President Donald Trump will keep up pressure to drop rates.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted \"strongly differing views about how to proceed,\" chilling market certainty by saying that a December cut was not a foregone conclusion.\n\nAnd opaqueness on the economy remains. November inflation data is out in the week to come. Some data has trickled in since the government reopened on November 13, still October and November jobs data only comes out after the Fed meeting.\n\nRate futures reflect confidence in a quarter point cut, but traders are mercurial. Odds recently were less than 50/50.\n\nChina's struggle with a years-long property slump and anaemic domestic demand shows little sign of recovery even as the year's end draws closer, with the clock ticking for Beijing to deliver more stimulus to shore up its economy.\n\nTrade data due Monday and inflation figures on Wednesday could paint a similarly downbeat picture, keeping investors focused on the economic agenda for the year ahead to be unveiled later this month.\n\nDefaults are also in the spotlight, as China Vanke, once the country's top home builder by sales, seeks a one-year extension on its onshore bond repayment.\n\nA bondholder meeting is set for December 10.\n\nDown Under, Australia's central bank meets Tuesday and is likely to leave rates unchanged in an economy that's still running hot.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank will almost certainly keep rates at 0% when it meets on Thursday. They are expected to stay stuck there in 2026, even though inflation has slipped towards the lower end of the SNB's range.\n\nOfficials expect inflation to rise, but also say they would tolerate a temporary blip below 0%. U.S. tariffs aren't helping, but one of the SNB's biggest headaches is homegrown: the currency.\n\nThe franc has appreciated nearly 12% against the dollar this year, set for its strongest year since 2002. The Swissie has barely moved against the euro in 2025 , but over the last five years, it has gained 14%.\n\nBearing in mind that Europe is Switzerland's largest market, accounting for around half of total exports, this strength is hurting everyone from watchmakers to wealth managers.\n\nTurkey's central bank will set rates on Thursday - there's little doubt it will cut, but by how much is hotly debated.\n\nNovember inflation, at just over 31%, has come in surprisingly soft on the headline number thanks to declining food prices, but rising pressures from services, including rent, make inflation stickier than hoped.\n\nThe central bank's end-2025 inflation target stands at 24%, with its forecast range at 31%-33%. Markets are watching this final policy meeting of the year for signals on the pace of future easing, with the main rate now at 39.5%. JPMorgan expects a 100 basis point cut, but doesn't rule out a 150-bps trim.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil's central bank is expected to keep its rates at 20-year highs of 15% on Wednesday, but a sharper than expected economic slowdown has fuelled bets a cut could come in January.\n\nWith bitcoin's recent wobble (it suffered its biggest monthly fall in November since February) and Japanese bonds taking a whack, you'd think alarm bells of caution would be ringing.\n\nYet, the smart people in the room seem decidedly upbeat on the year ahead, judging by some of the 2026 outlooks emerging. They're largely sticking with bullish bets on equities - especially in the tech-driven U.S. market.\n\nLombard Odier calls it the re-acceleration trade, with global economic growth expected to drive a \"diversified\" stocks rally. BNP Paribas has an above-consensus forecast for euro zone growth.\n\nThe euro is rallying again, and even talk of an AI bubble bursting hasn't really dented stocks.\n\nPerhaps the degree of optimism itself - in markets where consensus trades have not always got it right - warrants some caution.\n\n(This story has been refiled to fix the date to Dec. 5 from Dec. 4)",

Another 350 are missing, government data shows.\n\nWith the cyclone leaving deep fissures in the earth and cracked walls in homes, many of those in relief facilities are staying put.\n\n\"People are scared to go home, they don’t feel safe,\" said Madullegedera Chandralatha, 57, a resident of Kithulbadde, a scenic village nestled in the midst of hills among tea plantations.\n\nA total of 1,289 houses across the country have been destroyed by Cyclone Ditwah, while 44,500 more are partially damaged, according to the government, which is collecting data to provide \"long-term solutions\" to those living in high-risk areas.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said on Thursday it was assessing the country's economic needs after the disaster, while it still plans to have a board meeting on December 15 to discuss the last review of the current loan program, agreed with staff in October.\n\nThe Fund is \"looking into options to further support Sri Lanka in the recovery process,\" according to spokesperson Julie Kozack.\n\nPrasanna Shantha Kumara’s home is among those affected, its living room lined with deep gashes and the walls cracked in several places.\n\nThe 48-year-old now shuttles daily between the relief centre, to which he has moved with his wife and three children, and his home, attempting to revive his capsicum crop that was flattened by floods and is slowly dying.\n\nMany others do a similar commute daily to tend their tea plots and vegetable patches of chillies and cabbage, or to check on their pets, returning to the relief centres at night.\n\n\"I have lost my house, and my crop ...

    "content": "LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Global shares rose on Friday, heading for a second week of gains, ahead of a key read of U.S. inflation that investors are confident will not prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting rates next week, which weighed on the dollar and boosted gold.\n\nEuropean stock markets opened higher, propelled by gains in mining stocks, after the price of copper hit record highs. The STOXX 600 (.STOXX), opens new tab, which has gained 0.7% this week, was up 0.3% by mid-morning. U.S. stock futures , were up 0.2% to 0.4%, pointing to a modest rally on Wall Street later.\n\nGovernment bonds, which have been at the centre of a lot of market action this week, traded steadily ahead of monthly U.S. core inflation data.\n\nJapanese government bonds have led a global debt selloff this week. Yields on 10-year JGBs have hit their highest point since mid-2007, while 30-year yields have hit record highs, after the Bank of Japan gave its strongest signal yet this week that rates were likely to rise this month.\n\n\"If they do proceed, that would take the policy rate up to 0.75%, the highest since 1995,\" said Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. \"That’s led to a hawkish reaction among Japanese assets, with the yen strengthening 0.18% this morning against the U.S. dollar, whilst the Nikkei is down 1.29%.\"\n\nThe dollar was last down 0.1% on the day at 154.91 yen, off last week's 10-month high of 157.9.\n\nThe U.S. currency was under broad pressure on Friday, having steadied overnight after falling for nine straight sessions. The dollar index was down 0.1% to 99 - and down 0.5% for the week.\n\nWith the BOJ widely expected to deliver a rate rise just as the Fed resumes cutting, investors are buying the Japanese yen against the dollar as interest rates in the two countries edged towards one another. Traders frequently borrow the yen to then sell it and buy higher-yielding assets in dollars, like tech stocks or cryptocurrencies - this is known as a carry trade. A stronger yen puts billions of dollars invested in this trade at risk.\n\n\"What's going to be interesting about that (BOJ meeting): is, is 'it one and done?' I think that's going to be the big focus for both central banks, for the Fed and for the BOJ,\" said City Index strategist Fiona Cincotta. \"So it feels like even though we're in December and things should be winding down, there are still two major risk events.\"\n\nThe weakness in the U.S. currency has been driven by expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter point next Wednesday and deliver at least two reductions in 2026.\n\nWhile markets are 90% priced for a Fed rate cut, it could be the most contentious decision in years for the central bank because as many as five of the 12 voting members have publicly said they oppose reducing rates further.\n\nNext up is the September personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation - which is expected to show a 0.2% rise in the core measure, leaving the annual rate unchanged at 2.9%.\n\nData on Thursday showed jobless claims fell last week, assuaging concerns about a sharp deterioration in the labour market, but that might be due to the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nTreasury yields held steady on Friday after rising the previous day. Two-year Treasury yields fell 1 basis point to 3.527%, having risen 5 basis points overnight, while the 10-year yield was virtually unchanged at 4.11%.\n\nIn commodities, benchmark copper futures hit an all-time high of $11,705 a tonne earlier, after Citi upgraded its price forecast based on supply concerns and expectations for a Fed rate cut.\n\nBrent crude futures were set to end the week 0.2% lower at $63.2 a barrel, down around 0.1% on the day, while gold was up 0.3% to $4,221 an ounce.

Economists surveyed by LSEG expect a 0.2% monthly increase in the core number.\n\nThat is not seen changing expectations the Fed will cut rates by a quarter-point when the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets on December 9-10, and the focus will be on any signals about how much additional easing lies ahead.\n\nTraders are pricing an 86% chance of a Fed cut next week, and potentially two more reductions next year, LSEG data showed.\n\nInvestors are also weighing the prospect of White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett taking over as Fed Chair after Jerome Powell’s term ends in May. Hassett is expected to push for more rate cuts.\n\nThe dollar \"remains slightly offered on the view that the Fed will cut rates next week and that the arrival of Kevin Hassett as Fed Chair will somehow make the Fed more dovish,\" said Chris Turner, Global Head of Markets at ING.\n\nThe U.S. labour market has also been in focus, as an indication for the Fed to determine whether the economy needs further support.\n\nData overnight showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell to a more than three-year low last week, but may have been skewed by the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThe data picture remains incomplete after the record-long government shutdown delayed some releases and prevented other data from being collected.\n\nCrucial monthly payrolls figures would ordinarily be published later on Friday, but have been delayed until mid-December, and the previous month's numbers were never released.\n\nElsewhere, the dollar dropped 0.12% to 154.92 yen , after hitting its lowest since November 17.\n\nBOJ officials are ready to raise rates on December 19, in the absence of any major economic shocks, Bloomberg reported on Friday, a day after Reuters reported three sources as saying a hike this month was likely.\n\nThe euro gained 0.1% to $1.1651, heading back towards Thursday's three-week high of $1.1682.\n\nSterling added 0.15% to $1.3346, approaching the previous session's six-week peak of $1.3385.\n\nNext week sees a parade of central bank policy decisions, with the Reserve Bank of Australia's coming on Tuesday, the Bank of Canada's on Wednesday and the Swiss National Bank's on Thursday.\n\nThat continues the following week with the BOJ, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Sweden's Riksbank.\n\nThe Aussie was up 0.3% to $0.6626, after touching a more than two-month high.\n\nThe Swiss franc gained 0.1% to 0.8029 per dollar after dropping back sharply from Wednesday's two-week high of 0.7992 in the previous session.",

A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a rise of 0.4%.\n\nThe figure was boosted by an 87.1% month-on-month increase under the \"other transport equipment\" category - which includes aircraft, ships, trains and military vehicles.\n\nLBBW economist Jens-Oliver Niklasch pointed to a 9.9% increase in domestic orders from the previous month which he said could have been partly driven by government incentives to revive the economy following two years of contraction.\n\n\"The German government's 'investment booster' programme may be having an effect here,\" he said, referring to a package of measures approved in June including better depreciation options for companies to incentivise investment.\n\nNiklasch said the domestic rise could also be down to rearmament orders, following an increase in defence spending.\n\nIn March, Germany's parliament approved plans for a massive spending surge, including a 500-billion euro ($582.60 billion) special fund for infrastructure and plans to largely remove defence investment from the rules that cap borrowing.\n\nExcluding big-ticket items, overall new orders were up just 0.5% compared with the previous month, the data showed on Friday.\n\nForeign orders were down 4.0% compared with the previous month.\n\nThe less-volatile three-month on three-month comparison showed that overall new orders in the period from August to October were 0.5% lower than in the previous three months.\n\nAfter revision of the provisional data, new orders in September increased by 2.0% on August, instead of the preliminary figure of 1.1%.\n\nThe revision means that the core indicator for orders continued to move sideways, Ralph Solveen, senior economist at Commerzbank, said.\n\n\"This suggests that the industry has stabilized, but there are still no signs of an upturn.\"\n\n($1 = 0.8582 euros)",

He said the bank was already helping the state to manage its assets.\n\nHowever, in a statement to Reuters, NCH said that NCH Agribusiness Partners, a private equity fund owned by a group of U.S. institutional investors and managed by New York-based NCH Capital, has \"no plans to sell AgroTerra and is not in negotiations with any party regarding a possible sale.\"\n\nNCH's reluctance to sell its Russian assets to VTB may affect the bank's ambitions to build a national agriculture champion for Russia.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters this week, Kostin said VTB planned to create a large agricultural holding company from assets it has acquired. The bank bought previously nationalised agricultural assets in southern regions in December 2024.\n\nAgroTerra operates in several central regions, cultivating 265,000 hectares and running 19 grain elevators with capacity to store up to 500,000 metric tons of grain. NCH said that NCH Agribusiness Partners created the company from scratch in 2008.\n\n\"Since April 2024, NCH Agribusiness Partners has not had access to information regarding the operations of AgroTerra, nor has it been involved in any decision-making concerning its activities,\" NCH said.\n\n\"Prior to the imposition of temporary administration, AgroTerra was operating successfully and in full compliance with applicable laws with no intention to exit the market,\" it added.\n\nVTB is under U.S. sanctions and has hundreds of millions of dollars in assets frozen in the West as a result.\n\nKostin said the new holding company, whose creation could take up to five years, would focus on domestic processing of grains and other products and suggested it might be sold later.",

The two men then travelled together in the same vehicle for a private dinner hosted by Modi.\n\nOn Friday, Putin was given a ceremonial welcome on the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, the colonial-era presidential palace, with a 21-gun salute as his convoy drove in.\n\nThe two sides are expected to announce a raft of deals at the end of formal talks.\n\nIndian firms are expected to sign an agreement with Uralchem group, Russia's top potash and ammonium nitrate producer, to jointly set up a urea plant in Russia, Reuters reported on Thursday.\n\nRussian lenders Gazprombank (GZPRI.MM)and Alfa Bank have also sought approval to begin operating in India to help Moscow boost its trade with India, Reuters reported.\n\nModi and Putin are also expected to discuss topics including labour and civil nuclear energy.\n\nA large business and government delegation has accompanied Putin for the visit, including Defence Minister Andrei Belousov who held talks with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh on Thursday.\n\nBelousov stated that \"the Russian defence industry is ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in the field of defence production,\" India's defence ministry said after the talks.\n\nIn an interview with broadcaster India Today that was aired late on Thursday, Putin challenged U.S. pressure on India not to buy Russian fuel when the U.S. could purchase Russian nuclear fuel.\n\n\"If the U.S. has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege? This question deserves thorough examination, and we stand ready to discuss it, including with President Trump,\" Putin said.\n\nHe also said that while there was a minor dip in India-Russia trade during the first nine months of this year, energy trade was \"running smoothly\".\n\nIndia has said Trump's tariffs are unjustified and unreasonable and pointed at ongoing U.S. trade with Moscow. The U.S. and European Union continue to import billions of dollars worth of Russian energy and commodities, ranging from liquefied natural gas to enriched uranium.\n\nPutin arrived in India a day after holding talks with Trump's top envoys on a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, but they did not reach a compromise.\n\nIndia has resisted condemning Russia over the war and called for peace through dialogue and diplomacy, while saying that its ties with Moscow were being unfairly targeted by Western nations that it said continued to do business with Moscow when it was in their interest.\n\n\"India faces a conundrum; by taking steps to strengthen ties with Moscow or Washington, New Delhi risks setting back ties with the other,\" Michael Kugelman, senior fellow at Washington's Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this week.",

The European production arm has halted wafer shipments to China, citing nonpayment. Stockpiles of the company's chips are dwindling and the car industry fears shortages may re-emerge.\n\nKarremans said on Thursday he is focused on resolving those problems.",

Israel accuses its critics of mounting a global smear campaign against it.\n\nAfter a meeting in Geneva, the European Broadcasting Union, or EBU, decided not to call a vote on Israel's participation, saying it had instead passed new rules aimed at discouraging governments from influencing the contest.\n\nRight after that announcement by the contest organiser, the Dutch, Spanish, Irish and Slovenian broadcasters said they would withdraw, meaning singers from their countries would not compete in the contest that draws millions of viewers worldwide.\n\nBen Robertson, a Eurovision expert from fan website ESC Insight, said the contest's integrity was at its lowest ebb.\n\n\"Never in the history of the contest have we had such a vote, and such a split, between the member broadcasters of the European Broadcasting Union,\" he said.\n\nBoth the Israeli government and opposition leaders celebrated the country's inclusion.\n\nGolan Yochpaz, CEO of Israeli broadcaster KAN, likened the efforts to exclude Israel to a form of \"cultural boycott.\"\n\nRounding on the countries withdrawing, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on X: \"The disgrace is upon them.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest dates back to 1956 and reaches around 160 million viewers, according to the EBU - more than the almost 128 million recorded for this year's U.S. Super Bowl, according to figures from Nielsen.\n\nIsrael's participation has divided opinion in the competition that has a history of entanglement in national rivalries, international issues and political voting.\n\nIts 2025 entrant, Yuval Raphael, was at the Nova music festival, a target of the October 7, 2023 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel that triggered the Gaza war.\n\nA total of 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the assault by Hamas, according to Israeli tallies. More than 70,000 people have been killed in Gaza in the ensuing conflict, according to health authorities in the enclave.\n\nIrish broadcaster RTE said it felt \"Ireland's participation remains unconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there which continues to put the lives of so many civilians at risk\".\n\nJose Pablo Lopez, head of Spanish state broadcaster RTVE said on X: \"What happened in the EBU Assembly confirms that Eurovision is not a song contest but a festival dominated by geopolitical interests and fractured.\"\n\nRTV Slovenija said it together with Spain, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Turkey, Algeria and Iceland requested a secret vote on Israel's participation, but it was not held.\n\nIcelandic public broadcaster RUV said its board will make a decision on Wednesday on whether to participate in the next Eurovision, which will be held in Vienna in May.\n\n\"I feel sad that other countries are not going to compete next year,\" said 33-year-old Tel Aviv Eurovision fan Jurij Vlasov, adding the Netherlands' song this year was his favorite.\n\nIn Austria, which backed Israel, Eurovision fans welcomed its inclusion, even as some in Spain took the opposite view.\n\n\"Why should the population, or a part of the population, not participate?,\" said Vienna resident Bernhard Kleemann. \"If countries decide not to participate because they condemn the government and the prime minister, that's their decision.\"\n\nInstead of voting on Israel, the EBU said its members backed rules intended to discourage governments and third parties from disproportionately promoting songs to sway voters after allegations that Israel unfairly boosted its 2025 entrant.\n\n\"This vote means that all EBU Members who wish to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 and agree to comply with the new rules are eligible to take part,\" it said.\n\nIsrael's President Isaac Herzog thanked his country's supporters, saying he hoped the song contest would continue to champion \"culture, music, friendship between nations\".\n\nGermany, a major Eurovision backer, had signalled it would not take part if Israel was barred. Germany's culture minister Wolfram Weimer told the Bild newspaper he welcomed the decision.\n\n\"Israel belongs to the Eurovision Song Contest like Germany belongs to Europe,\" he said.\n\nMartin Green, the contest's director, said EBU members showed they wanted to protect the neutrality of the competition.\n\n\"Eurovision was born from the ashes of the Second World War,\" he said. \"It was designed to bring us together, and it will hit bumps in the road, and we have a complicated world, but we hope it's a temporary situation, and we'll move forward.\"",

    "content": "NEW DELHI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.NS), opens new tab will pay into Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field abandonment fund in roubles, using Indian companies' frozen dividends to retain its 20% stake in the project, three sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of India's top explorer ONGC, and other state-run Indian companies have not been able to repatriate about $800 million in dividends from stakes in Russian energy assets due to sanctions, the industry sources said.\n\nAhead of Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to New Delhi this week, the Indian companies agreed to give ONGC Videsh a loan from those stuck dividends so it can make a contribution to the abandonment fund, the sources added.\n\nThe Indian companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, nor did Rosneft, whose Sakhalinmorneftegaz-shelf subsidiary now operates Sakhalin-1.\n\nAn abandonment fund is used for decommissioning activities to ensure that wells are properly shut in and that the process will not affect the environment.\n\nA raft of Western sanctions, imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, has made it difficult for ONGC Videsh to transfer funds to Russia in dollars, and payment in roubles requires approval from the Russian authorities.\n\nONGC Videsh has been trying to retain its 20% stake in the Sakhalin-1 project since October of that year, when Putin ordered the seizure of the project and allowed the Russian government to decide foreign investors' ownership rights in the project.\n\nRussia has allowed ONGC Videsh to contribute roubles to the fund using the pending dividends of Indian companies, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nIn August Putin signed a decree that allowed foreign investors to regain shares in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project.\n\nThe decree stipulated that foreign shareholders must undertake actions to support the lifting of Western sanctions if they want to regain their share.\n\nThey must also conclude contracts for supplies of necessary foreign-made equipment to the project, and transfer funds to Sakhalin-1 project accounts.",

    "title": "After streak-ending victory, LeBron James, Lakers head to Boston",
    "content": "December 5 - One night after his NBA-record streak of double-digit scoring games ended in dramatic and unselfish fashion, LeBron James will aim to keep the Los Angeles Lakers rolling when they visit the Boston Celtics on Friday.\n\nLos Angeles earned a 123-120 road win over the Toronto Raptors on Thursday when James assisted on Rui Hachimura's 3-pointer at the buzzer.\n\nJames scored eight points in the game, the first time since 2007 that he didn't score at least 10, ending a streak of 1,297 games in which he reached double figures. He shot 4 of 17 from the field and missed each of his five 3-point attempts.\n\nJames expressed no regrets about deciding to pass at the end rather than shoot in an attempt to win the game and extend the streak. In the end, Hachimura was the hero even over teammate Austin Reaves, who logged 44 points, 10 rebounds and five assists.\n\n\"Just playing the game the right way,\" James said. \"You always make the right play. That's just been my M.O. That's how I was taught the game. I've done that my whole career. ...\n\n\"Once they doubled (Reaves) and the ball got swung to me, I knew it was a numbers game. We had a 4-on-3 advantage, and I was just trying to put the ball on time on target.\"\n\nLakers coach JJ Redick said of James' final play, \"The basketball gods, if you do it the right way, they tend to reward you.\"\n\nReaves and Hachimura might be asked for more heroics on Friday if Lakers star Luka Doncic misses a second game in a row, as is expected. The team officially listed his Thursday absence as being for personal reasons, with no details provided, but multiple media outlets reported that he was in his native Slovenia awaiting the birth of a child.\n\n\"We hope to get him back soon,\" said Redick, whose team has won eight of its past nine games. \"... Don't have a pinpointed day, though.\"\n\nThe Lakers also prevailed in Toronto without veteran guard Marcus Smart, who spent the first nine years of his NBA career with the Celtics. Smart sat out his fourth consecutive game because of lower back injury management and is considered day-to-day.\n\nLike the Lakers, the Celtics were missing their top scorer when they earned a win on Thursday.\n\nJaylen Brown sat out due to an illness, but Boston demolished the host Washington Wizards 146-101.\n\nCeltics coach Joe Mazzulla was coy when he was asked if Brown would play against the Lakers.\n\n\"I'm not a doctor,\" he said. \"Sorry, I have no idea.\"\n\nJordan Walsh made each of his eight field-goal attempts and tossed in a career-high 22 points for Boston. Walsh, who also collected seven rebounds in the win, has made each of his past 13 shots from the floor.\n\n\"Honestly, I (keep) forgetting what happens on offense,\" Walsh said. \"When I score, I lowkey forget what happened (because) I'm so focused on getting back on defense. It leaves my mind, but whenever I get a steal and a dunk, or like a steal and a rebound, that stays with me. ... Defense always sticks with me for some reason.\"\n\nBoston is 8-2 since Walsh was moved into the starting lineup.\n\n\"I thought Jordan set the tone on both ends of the floor,\" Mazzulla said. \"He was unscreenable and did a great job making plays defensively.\"\n\nThe Celtics and Lakers split their two-game regular-season series in seven of the past eight campaigns, the lone exception being a Boston sweep in 2022-23.\n\n--Field Level Media",

    "title": "The US-Venezuela relationship as seen through the price of an oil-linked bond",
    "content": "NEW YORK, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The ramp-up of U.S. pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government is bringing fresh attention to the nation's defaulted bonds, including those of the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.\n\nVenezuela defaulted on its debt in 2017 but PDVSA continued to pay holders of a specific bond maturing in 2020. It was issued in 2016 under a swap offer that replaced debt maturing the following year. This bond is secured with a pledge of 50.1% of refiner Citgo Holding through PDVSA’s wholly-owned subsidiary PDV Holding. But payments stopped after the opposition-led National Assembly declared the bond contract illegal in October 2019.\n\nCanadian miner Crystallex International earlier in 2016 had won a $1.4 billion arbitration against Venezuela over the expropriation of a project by the government of Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez.\n\nCrystallex later convinced a U.S. court that PDV Holding was the alter ego of Venezuela, so the court found the company liable for the country's debt. The process eventually spawned an auction of PDV Holding shares decided last month in favor of an affiliate of hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, which has set $2.1 billion aside to pay and extinguish the PDVSA 2020 bond.\n\nThe sale to Elliott's Amber Energy will not be executed until the U.S. Treasury gives it a green light.\n\nMeanwhile Venezuela’s broader debt crisis and U.S. sanctions dragged the bond price lower, trading as low as 10 cents on the dollar in mid-2020. Court-related developments, importantly the initial confirmation in 2020 that the debt was enforceable under New York law, revived investor interest.\n\nThe removal of many U.S. sanctions in October 2023 served as a renewed catalyst, boosting prices above 80 cents on the dollar, where they have remained for most of the time since. The ratcheting up of U.S. military pressure on the Maduro administration took the bond price to par for the first time in September, and on Thursday the bond closed at 100.25 cents on the dollar.",
